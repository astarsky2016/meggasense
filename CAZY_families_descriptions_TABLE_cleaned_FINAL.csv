However, other commonly found activities are 6-phospho-?-glucosidase and 6-phospho-?-galactosidase, ?-mannosidase, ?-D-fucosidase and ?-glucuronidase. Family GH1 enzymes are found across a broad spectrum of life forms. Enzymes of medical interest include the human lactase/phlorizin hydrolase whose deficiency leads to lactose intolerance. In plants Family GH1 enzymes are often involved in the processing of glycosylated aromatics such as saponins and some plant hormones stored in inactive glycosylated forms. Indeed some have been identified as plant oncogenes due to aberrant control of auxin levels. Some plants also use Family GH1 enzymes as part of their defense system in order to release toxic aglycons, the most known examples being Trifolium repens ?-glucosidase and Sinapis alba myrosinase, which respectively hydrolyse linamarin and glucosinolates. One of the work horses of glycosidase enzymology, the almond emulsin ?-glucosidase, even though not fully sequenced, is deduced to belong to Family GH1 by limited sequence analysis.;Family GH1 ?-glycosidases are retaining enzymes, as first shown by NMR and follow a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. Enzymes that have been well-studied kinetically include the almond emulsin enzyme, for which a particularly nice and important set of studies on rate-limiting steps and inhibition was reported in the mid 1980’s and the Agrobacterium sp. ?-glucosidase which has been the subject of a series of kinetic evaluations, including detailed steady state and pre-steady state kinetic analyses in which the roles of each substrate hydroxyl in catalysis have also been carefully probed.;The catalytic nucleophile was first identified in the Agrobacterium sp. ß-glucosidase as Glu358 in the sequence YITENG through trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping. The general acid/base catalyst was first identified as Glu170 in this same enzyme through detailed mechanistic analysis of mutants at that position, which included azide rescue experiments. Family GH1 enzymes, as is typical of Clan GH-A, have an asparagine residue preceding the general acid/base catalyst in a typical NEP sequence. The asparagine engages in important hydrogen bonding interactions with the substrate 2-hydroxyl. Interestingly, the plant myrosinases cleave thioglycosides bearing an anionic aglycone (glucosinolates), and have evolved an active site in which the acid/base glutamate is replaced by glutamine. Substrates are sufficiently reactive not to require the acid catalyst, while the role of base catalyst is played by exogenous ascorbate, which binds to the glycosyl enzyme.;Three-dimensional structures are available for a large number of Family 1 enzymes, the first solved being that of the white clover (Trifolium repens) cyanogenic ß-glucosidase. As members of Clan GH-A they have a classical (?/ß)8 TIM barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids being approximately 200 residues apart in sequence and located at the C-terminal ends of ß-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile).;;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;2cer;?-glycosidase S;Sulfolobus solfataricus P2;phenethyl glucoimidazol;Glu206;Glu387;[3]
GH2;"ß-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) ; ß-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25); ß-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31); mannosylglycoprotein endo-ß-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.152); exo-ß-glucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.165)";The most common activities for glycoside hydrolases of this family include ß-galactosidases, ß-glucuronidases, ß-mannosidases, exo-ß-glucosaminidases and, in plants, a mannosylglycoprotein endo-ß-mannosidase. The enzymes are found across a broad spectrum of life forms, but are concentrated in bacteria. The most famous enzyme in this family is the E. coli (lacZ) ß-galactosidase, a component of the lac operon. Not only did this enzyme play a key role in developing the understanding of operon structure and control of gene expression, but also it continues to play a key role as a cell biological probe. Another matter of note is that this remains the largest protein monomer to be sequenced entirely at the peptide level. E. coli also contains a second, vestigial ß-galactosidase (ebg) whose activity has been shown to evolve in lacZ- strains of E. coli grown under selective pressure with lactose as sole carbon source. Another reasonably well-studied GH2 enzyme is the E. coli ß-glucuronidase, whose activity is used to detect the presence of E. coli (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~ebam/bam-4.html), though interestingly not the nasty O157 strain. The principal enzyme of medical interest in GH2 is the lysosomal ß-glucuronidase whose deficiency leads to Sly syndrome. The only other human GH2 enzyme is the lysosomal ß-mannosidase.;Family 2 ß-glycosidases are retaining enzymes, as first shown by XXXXX and follow a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. The best studied enzyme kinetically must be the E. coli (lacZ) ß-galactosidase, for which a key set of studies defining the two-step mechanism and elucidating rate-limiting steps was published by the groups of Yon and Sinnott in the early 1970’s. Indeed the approaches developed on that system laid the foundations for many subsequent studies on other glycosidases. An analysis of the roles of each substrate hydroxyl in catalysis, based upon kinetic studies with modified sugars has also been published. Some GH2 glycosidases require Mg2+ for activity and in E. coliß-galactosidase this Mg2+ requirement is associated with the binding of the cation in the active site such that it places the acid/base residue appropriately. Others, such as the human ß-glucuronidase, have no such metal ion requirement.;The catalytic nucleophile in GH2 was first correctly identified in the E. coli (lacZ) ß-galactosidase as Glu537 in the sequence ILCEYAH through trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluorogalactosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping via HPLC techniques using radiolabeled tracers. Earlier studies, carefully done using conduritol C cis-epoxide as affinity label, had identified Glu461 as the labeled residue, on which basis a series of beautifully executed kinetic studies were performed on mutants modified at this position that appeared initially to support this conclusion. However, doubts were raised when similar kinetic analysis of nucleophile mutants of the GH1 Agrobacterium sp. ß-glucosidase yielded quite different results, leading to the above labeling study. The general acid/base catalyst was then identified as Glu461 by re-interpretation of the published kinetic results on mutants at that position, which had included azide rescue experiments. These conclusions were fully supported by subsequent 3-dimensional structural analyses (below).;Three-dimensional structures are available for five Family GH2 enzymes currently, the first solved being that of the E. coli (lacZ) ?-galactosidase in a tour de force of X-ray crystallography at that time, given its huge size (4 x 125,000 Da). The enzyme is multidomain, but as members of Clan GHA the catalytic domains a classical (?/?)8 TIM barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids being approximately 200 residues apart in sequence and located at the C-terminal ends of ?-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile).;;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;2vzu;exo-?-glucosaminidase;Amicolatopsis orientalis;PNP-?-d-glucosamine;Glu469;Glu541;[4]

Their classification is based largely on nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities of the corresponding genes. Relatively few members of the enzyme family have been purified and characterised in detail. The family 3 enzymes have been classified as ?-D-glucosidases, ?-L-arabinofuranosidases, ?-D-xylopyranosidases and N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidases. In many cases the enzymes have dual or broad substrate specificities with respect to monosaccharide residues, linkage position and chain length of the substrate. For example, there are several well characterized ‘bifunctional’ enzymes in the family that have both ?-L-arabinofuranosidase and ?-D-xylopyranosidase activity. In another example, the family 3 ?-D-glucosidases from barley, which are more precisely referred to as ?-D-glucan glucohydrolases, are broad specificity exo-hydrolases that remove single glucosyl residues from the non-reducing ends of a range of ?-D-glucans, ?-D-oligoglucosides and aryl b-D-glucosides, including (1,3)-?-D-glucans, (1,4)-?-D-glucans, (1,3;1,4)-?-D-glucans and (1,6)-?-D-glucans, 4-nitrophenyl ?-D-glucoside, certain cyanogenic ?-D-glucosides and some ?-D-oligoxyloglucosides. In contrast, family 3 N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidases (NagZ) are ‘monofunctional’ glycoside hydrolases that remove N-acetyl-?-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) from glycoconjugates. Highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, NagZ enzymes play an important role in peptidoglycan recycling by removing GlcNAc from 1,6-anhydroMurNAc-peptides, and this activity has been shown to mediate the induction of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase.";Family 3 glycoside hydrolases remove single glycosyl residues from the non-reducing ends of their substrates. Catalysis occurs via a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism with the ?-anomeric configuration of the released glycose being retained. The stereochemistry of the reaction has been determined experimentally for some family 3 enzymes. Detailed kinetic analyses are available for two purified barley ?-D-glucan glucohydrolases and two barley ‘bifunctional’ ?-L-arabinofuranosidase/?-D-xylopyranosidases. Detailed kinetic data are also available for a N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidase from Vibrio furnisii (ExoII);The catalytic amino acid residues for the barley ?-D-glucan glucohydrolases have been identified by chemical and three-dimensional structural procedures. The substrate-binding site consists of two glucosyl-binding subsites and the catalytic amino acid residues are located between these two subsites. In the plant family 3 ?-D-glycosidases the catalytic nucleophile is Asp285, which is located in a highly conserved GFVISDW motif. The general acid, E491, is highly conserved in plant family 3 enzymes but is more difficult to locate in more distantly related members of the family. The reaction sequence and mechanism have been defined for this enzyme using a range of synthetic inhibitors. The catalytic nucleophile for Vibrio furnisii ExoII (a NagZ) has been identified chemically as Asp242, which is conserved throughout the family 3 NagZ enzymes. A general acid residue has not been identified for family 3 NagZ enzymes.;"The family 3 ?-D-glycosidases are globular monomeric enzymes of molecular mass around 60-70 kDa. The 3D structure of the ?-D-glucan glucohydrolase isoenzyme ExoII from barley, determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.2 ? resolution, shows a two-domain, globular protein of 605 amino acid residues that is N-glycosylated at three sites. The two domains are connected by a 16-amino acid helix-like linker. The first 357 residues constitute a (?/?)8 TIM barrel domain. The second domain consists of residues 374 to 559 arranged in a six-stranded ?-sandwich, which contains a ?-sheet of five parallel ?-strands and one antiparallel ?-strand, with 3 ?-helices on either side of the sheet. A long antiparallel loop of 42 amino acid residues is found at the COOH-terminus of the enzyme. In some bacterial GH3 enzymes the order of the domains is reversed. The active site of the barley ?-D-glucan glucohydrolase consists of a relatively shallow substrate-binding pocket that is located at the interface of the two domains of the enzyme. The active site pocket can accommodate the two glucosyl residues at the non-reducing terminus of the substrate and aligns the non-reducing terminal glycosidic linkage of the substrate with the catalytic amino acid residues Asp285 and Glu491. Thus, the catalytic amino acid residues are located on domains 1 and 2, respectively. The broad specificity of the barley ?-D-glucan glucohydrolase can be rationalized from the X-ray crystallographic data and from molecular modelling of enzyme-substrate complexes. The glucosyl residue occupying binding subsite –1 is tightly locked into a relatively fixed position through interactions with six amino acid residues near the bottom of the shallow active site pocket. In contrast, the glucosyl residue at subsite +1 is located between two tryptophan residues at the entrance of the pocket, where it is less tightly constrained. The flexibility of binding at subsite +1, coupled with the projection of the remainder of bound substrate away from the enzyme’s surface, means that the overall active site is largely independent of substrate conformation and will therefore accommodate a range of substrates in which the spatial dispositions of adjacent ?-D-glucosyl residues vary as a result of glycosidic linkages between different C atoms of the adjacent ?-D-glucosyl residues. Family 3 NagZ enzymes are also globular, yet have a mass of ~ 36 kDa, which is a distinctive feature of NagZ enzymes from others within the family. NagZ from Vibrio cholerae has been determined in complex with GlcNAc (PDB ID: 1Y65) and with the N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase inhibitor PUGNAc and NagZ selective PUGNAc derivatives. The enzyme is comprised of 340 amino acids and adopts a (?/?)8 TIM barrel fold. The active site pocket is shallow and accommodates the 2-N-acetyl group of a terminal GlcNAc sugar in a solvent accessible groove alongside the binding site for the pyranose ring. This active site architecture is different from the active site architectures the functionally-relatedGH20 N-acetyl-?-hexosaminidases and GH84 O-GlcNAcases. These latter families, which also remove ?-1,4-linked GlcNAc residues from glycoconjugates, use a mechanism involving neighboring group participation wherein the carbonyl oxygen of the 2-acetamido group of the terminal GlcNAc acts as a nucleophile, yielding an oxazolinium ion intermediate. Thus, unlike family 3 NagZ enzymes, GH20 and GH84 do not possess an enzymic catalytic nucleophile; however, they do have an appropriately positioned catalytic acid residue. Together, these mechanistic differences have allowed for the development of 2-N-acyl derivatives of PUGNAc that are selective for family 3 NagZ over GH20 and GH84enzymes.";;none;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;1iex;exo-1,3-1,4-glucanase;Hordeum vulgare;thiocellobiose;Glu491;Asp285;[5]

Unlike other families of glycosidases, some of the enzymes in Family 4 possess distinct substrate specificities from each other[1, 2]. This family contains ?-glucosidases, ?-galactosidases, ?-glucuronidases, 6-phospho-?-glucosidases, and 6-phospho-?-glucosidases. Similar to GH1, some enzymes prefer phosphorylated substrates over non-phosphorylated substrates. Unique to GH4 is the presence of both ?- and ?-glycosidases. The ability of a single enzyme to hydrolyze natural substrates of different anomeric configurations has not been discovered in other glycoside hydrolase families to-date. GH4 enzymes were the first glycosidases shown to demonstrate an absolute requirement for NAD+ and a divalent metal ion and in some instances reducing environments for catalytic activity. The cofactors are proposed to play key mechanistic roles in the atypical glycosidase mechanism. Unlike GH4, metal ions are required by some glycosidases for structural integrity or proper configuration of an active enzyme. Meanwhile, GH4 is the first family of glycoside hydrolases reported to require a NAD+ cofactor for catalytic activity. Subsequently, GH109 has more recently been shown to demonstrate the same use of a NAD+ cofactor, but this family does not require metal ions or reducing conditions for activity. The hydrolysis of thioglycosides with activated leaving groups has been documented in GH84, GH1. However, GH4 is currently the only family that has been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of unactivated thioglycoside substrates. The remarkable substrate specificities are all feasible due to the ?-elimination mechanism discussed below.;"GH4 enzymes have been shown to be retaining glycosidases. However, the enzymes do not utilize the classicalKoshland double-displacement mechanism. BglT (6-phospho-?-glucosidase) from Thermotoga maritima and GlvA (6-phospho-?-glucosidase) from Bacillus subtilis are two of the most thoroughly studied enzymes of this family, and both are proposed to utilize an NAD-dependent hydrolysis mechanism that proceeds through oxidation-elimination-addition-reduction steps via anionic transition states. Exchange of the substrate C2 proton with solvent deuterium during the enzyme-catalyzed reaction was the first indication of a C2-H2 bond cleavage in the substrate, which is inconsistent with the double-displacement mechanism. This fact coupled with the proximity of the NAD+ cofactor to C3 of the glucose 6-phosphate product and the high structural similarity to lactate/malate dehydrogenases as garnered from the x-ray crystallographic data, led to the following proposed mechanism: 1) C3 hydride abstraction via the reduction of NAD+ cofactor to NADH and consequent oxidation of the C3 hydroxyl group; 2) adjacent to the ketone functionality, the C2 proton is activated to deprotonation by a near-by catalytic base residue; 3) cleavage of the C1-O1 linkage occurs via an ?,?-elimination mechanism, producing an ?,?-unsaturated intermediate; 5) a 1,4-Michael-like addition of a water molecule at C1 takes place; and 6) reduction of the C3 carbonyl functionality by the ""on-board"" NADH generates the final hydrolysis product. Primary kinetic isotope effects and the determination of Br?nsted relationships revealed that both the C3 hydride and C2 proton abstractions are partially rate-limiting and that cleavage of the C1-O1 linkage is not rate-limiting. This led to the proposed E1cb mechanism for both BglT and GlvA.";The proposed catalytic residues were mostly derived from x-ray crystallographic data and pH-dependent activity profiles obtained for BglT and GlvA. A Tyr residue that is conserved in all 6-phospho-?- and 6-phospho-?-glycosidases was found to be approximately 4 ? away from C2 of the reaction product, which can potentially act as a general base. The pH-dependent activity profiles were that of double ionization curves with pHopt at approximately 8. Two pKa values of approximately 7 and 9 were determined. The pKa value of approximately 7 was proposed to correspond to that of the Tyr catalytic base, since this residue would need to be deprotonated for enzyme activity. The position of the Tyr in the enzyme active site was used as a possible explanation for the relatively low pKa compared to that of a free Tyr (pKa = 10). In the case of BglT, the Tyr residue is located at a distance of 3.4 ? from the glycosidic oxygen, making it ideal to assume a second role in providing general acid catalysis to the departing oxygen as well as C2 deprotonation. The pKa value of approximately 9 was proposed to correspond to the ionization of the conserved Arg residue(s) that were found to be within hydrogen bonding distance of the phosphate group of the substrate in these two 6-phospho-glycosidases. Again, the normal pKa of 12 for Arg could be lowered to 9, and this matches the expectation that protonated Arg residue(s) would be needed to form electrostatic interactions with the substrate phosphate moiety. Two other conserved residues, Cys and His, were shown to be responsible for chelating the metal ion in BglT and GlvA. In the AglA structure, an Asp residue occupies the same position as the catalytic Tyr base, so the Asp is proposed to take on this role in AglA and possibly other GH4 enzymes that prefer non-phosphorylated substrates.;Crystallographic data is available for a number of GH4 enzymes, including ?- and ?-members as well as those enzymes specific for phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated substrates. The x-ray crystal structures currently available for this family are those of the Thermotoga maritima ?-glucosidase AglA (PDB 1OBB), the T. maritima ?-glucosidase Agu4B (PDB 1VJT), theBacillus subtilis 6-phospo-?-glucosidase GlvA (PDB 1U8X), and two 6-phospho-?-glucosidases: one from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (PDB 1S6Y) and other BglT from T. maritima (PDB 1UP6). Each enzyme possesses the characteristic dinucleotide-binding Rossman fold. The crystal structures of Agu4B (PDB 1VJT) and the 6-phospho-?-glucosidase (PDB 1SY6) from do not provide useful information about the active sites. No ligands are bound in the structure of the 6-phospho-?-glucosidase from G. stearothermophilus. In the Agu4B structure, only the NAD+ cofactor is found at the enzyme active site, but no data for the nicotinamide ring is provided, possibly because it is not well-defined in the crystal structure. The AglA structure is that of an inactive enzyme with no divalent metal ion. The GH4 enzymes show some structural similarities to lactate/malate dehydrogenases as well as dehydratases.;The enzymes in this family display an unusual mechanism involving NAD+.;;;;;;;;;;;;

A variety of specificties are annotated to this family notably endoglucanase (cellulase) and endomannanase as well as exoglucanases, exomannanases and ?-glucosidase and ?-mannosidase. Other activities include 1,6-galactanase, 1,3-mannanase, 1,4-xylanase, endoglycoceramidase, as well as high specificity xyloglucanases. Family GH5 enzymes are found widely distributed across Archae, bacteria and eukaryotes, notably fungi and plants. There are no known human enzymes in GH5.;Family GH5 enzymes are retaining enzymes, as first shown by NMR and follow a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism.;GH5 enzymes use the classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism and the two catalytic residues (catalytic nucleophile and general acid/base) are known to be glutamates found at the C-terminal ends of ?-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile).;"Three-dimensional structures are available for a very large number of Family GH5 enzymes, the first solved being that of theClostridium thermocellum endoglucanase CelC. As members of Clan GH-A they have a classical (?/?)8 TIM barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids being approximately 200 residues apart in sequence and located at the C-terminal ends of ?-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile). With so many 3D structures in this family, covering many specificities it is clearly hard to pick out notable structural papers. TheBacillus agaradhaerens Cel5A has been extensively studied, notably in the trapping of enzymatic snapshots along the reaction coordinate but also as a testbed for glycosidase inhibitor design as crystals often diffract to atomic resolution (for example). The reaction coordinate work on the endoglucanases (thus working on gluco-configured substrates) shows that the substrate binds in 1S3 conformation with the glycosyl enzyme intermediate in 4C1 chair conformation implying catalysis via a near 4H3 half-chair transition state. By analogy with family GH26 mannnanases and family GH2 ?-mannosidases it would seem likely that GH5 mannanases use a different conformational itinerary to their glucosidase relatives, likely via a 1S5-OS2 glycosylation pathway and thus via aB2,5 (near) transition-state although direct evidence in this family is limited. An interesting dissection of mannan-degrading enzyme systems has been provided by work in the Gilbert group on the diverse GH5 and GH26 mannanases in Cellvibrio japonicus(see for example). The Rhodococcal endoglycoceramidase II (EGC) in this family has found application in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of ceramide derivatives. In 2007 the first 3-D structure of a highly specific GH5 xyloglucanase was reported; this enzyme makes kinetically productive interactions with both xylose and galactose substituents, as reflected in both a high specific activity on xyloglucan and the kinetics of a series of aryl glycosides.";"formerly known as cellulase family A; Following a recent paper by St John et al.

Only endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4) and cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.91) activity has been reported for the bacterial and eukaryotic members of this family.;"GH6 enzymes perform catalysis with inversion of anomeric stereochemistry, as first shown by NMR on cellobiohydrolase II (CBH II; Cel6A) from the fungus Trichoderma reesei (a clonal derivative of Hypocrea jecorina).";"The first 3D structure of CBHII provided a strong clue as to the identification of the catalytic general acid in the inverting mechanism (Asp 221 in the case of this Trichoderma reesei Cel6A enzyme). This assigment has withstood the tests of time with strong kinetic support (from kinetics as a function of leaving group ability for a series of enzyme variants) as well as from all subsequent 3-D analyses of enzyme-ligand complexes (for example ). The identification of the catalytic general base is, however, far less clear. Simply put this is because there is no clear potential base within hydrogen-bonding distance of a water molecule that could act as the nucleophile in the inverting mechanism. Thus, although there are mutagenesis / kinetic proposals for a base, the current 'Zeitgeist' is that the attacking water is deprotonated via a string of water molecules in what Sinnott has descibed as a ""Grotthuss"" mechanism; for which there is solvent kinetic isotope effect support. On the basis of structure the residue most likely to act as the general base is Asp175 on the Trichoderma reesei Cel6A, although Asp401 may also play a role (see Table 1).";"The first crystal structures of cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases from family GH6 revealed modified ?/? barrel folds which, unlike the classical (?/?)8 ""TIM"" barrel has just seven ?-strands forming the central ?-barrel. The CBHII structure revealed an active centre (see above) enclosed in a tunnel formed primarily by two surface loops. When, subsequently, the first endoglucanase from GH6 was solved, the active center was observed in a long open groove. The comparison of these two structures thus provided the first insight into how endo or processive activity was modulated, through display of the active centre in a in an open grove, or loop-enclosed tunnel, respectively. In 1995 the UBC group were able to truncate the extended loops of a cellobiohydrolase resulting in an enzyme with more endo-activity. To this day the debate continues about the possibilities of loop conformational change in moderating the activity of cellobiohydrolases between exo and endo. St?hlberg was perhaps the first to explicitly state that T. reesei ""has no true exo-cellulases"". It is clear that there is no absolute steric demand for theexo activity of cellobiohydrolases; the enzymes have a viable ""-3"" subsite, the loops of the cellobiohydrolases are clearly mobile and show multiple conformations (consistent with occasional opening to support endo-activity, and are also able to act on artificial substrates in which both ends have large appended groups (for example). The nature of how catalysis was achived, and the conformational itinerary of catalysis was first provided by the Uppsala, Grenoble and Gent groups in 1999 was a trapped Michaelis complex of a thio-oligosaccharide was observed spanning the active centre with the -1 subsite sugar in 2SO conformation, which suggested a pathway around the 2,5B transition stateconformation. Subsequent structural and modelling support for these proposals comes from similarly distorted species on other GH6 enzymes and from the observation of a ""cellobiosyl isofagomine"" in 2,5B conformation.";formerly known as cellulase family B.

Several members also show activity on xylan. The substrate specificities found in GH7 are: endo-1,4-?-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.-), chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132) and endo-1,3-1,4-?-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.73).;"Family 7 enzymes are retaining enzymes, as first shown by NMR analysis on cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I; Cel7A) from the fungus Trichoderma reesei (a clonal derivative of Hypocrea jecorina).";"In GH7 enzymes the catalytic residues are positioned close to each other in sequence in the consensus motif -Glu-X-Asp-X-X-Glu-, where the first Glu acts as catalytic nucleophile and the other Glu as general acid/base. This was proposed in the first 3-D structure publication, of Hypocrea jecorina Cel7A, based on the position of the residues relative to an o-iodo-benzyl-cellobioside molecule bound at the active site. It was supported by mutational studies with the same enzyme, which also showed that the Aspartate residue in the consensus motif is important for catalysis, and with Endoglucanase I (EG I, Cel7B) from Humicola insolens. The catalytic nucleophile was further supported by affinity labelling with 3,4-epoxybutyl-?-cellobioside; with Hypocrea jecorina Cel7A the identification was done by ESI-MS peptide mapping and sequencing, and with Fusarium oxysporum Endoglucanase I (EG I, Cel7B) the residue was identified by X-ray crystallography. This was subsequently verified by trapping of a 2-deoxy-2-fluorocellotriosyl covalent enzyme intermediate in Humicola insolens Cel7B and identification of the labelled peptide by tandem MS. The general acid/base has been inferred by homology to GH16, the other family in clan GH-B, where it has been verified by azide rescue of inactivated mutants of a Bacillus licheniformis 1,3-1,4-?-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase.";"Three-dimensional structures are available for both endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases of GH7. The first cellobiohydrolase structure, the catalytic module of Hypocrea jecorina Cel7A, was published in 1994 (CBH I; PDB 1cel), and the first endoglucanase, Fusarium oxysporum EG I (Cel7B), in 1996 (PDB 1ovw). The proteins are built up around a ?-jellyroll folded framework, in which two large anti-parallell ?-sheets pack face-to-face to form a highly curved ?-sandwich. The ?-sandwich is further extended along both edges by several of the loops that connect the ?-strands, resulting in a long (~50 ?) substrate-binding surface that runs perpendicular to the ?-strands of the inner, concave ?-sheet. A few short ?-helical segments occur in some of the loops at the perifery of the structure. Endoglucanases have an open substrate binding cleft/groove, while in cellobiohydrolases some loops are further elongated and bend around the active site so that a more or less closed tunnel is formed through the enzyme. Further structural studies have provided detailed knowledge about catalytic mechanism and substrate binding in family 7. ";formerly known as cellulase family C. The cellobiohydrolases of this family act processively from the reducing ends of cellulose chains to generate cellobiose.

All of GH8 members have been found from bacteria, and there are no members from Eukaryotic or Archaeal origin. The majority of the enzymes are endo-acting enzymes, but one member has an exo-activity that releases ?-D-xylose residues from the reducing end of xylooligosaccharides. The substrate specificities found in GH8 are: chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132), cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4), licheninase (EC 3.2.1.73), endo-1,4-?-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) and reducing-end-xylose releasing exo-oligoxylanase (EC 3.2.1.156).;Enzymes of glycoside hydrolase family 8 are inverting enzymes, as first shown by Fierobe et al. who monitored the reaction of endoglucanase C from Clostridium cellulolyticum (CelCCC) using proton NMR spectroscopy. Hydrolysis by CelA is computationally simulated with QM/MM metadynamics.;The general acid (proton donor to the leaving group) was first identified in CelA from C. thermocellum as Glu95. The general base (proton acceptor from the nucleophilic water) of GH8a subfamily was first identified in CelA from C. thermocellum as Asp278. The general base of GH8b subfamily was first identified in chitosanase from Bacillus sp. K17 as Glu309 based on its crystal structure and by making E309Q mutant.;Several three-dimensional structures of GH8 members from bacterial origin have been solved. The first solved 3-D structure was endoglucanase CelA from Clostridium thermocellum (PDB ID 1cem) in 1996. As members of Clan GH-M they have a (?/?)6 fold similar to Glycoside Hydrolase Family 48. The general acid residue is located at the N-terminal end of ?4 helix. Position of the general base differ among #Subfamilies. Atomic (0.94 ?) resolution structure of CelA in complex with substrate (PDB ID 1kwf) has been determined.;formerly known as cellulase family D.  GH8 enzymes are divided into at least three subfamilies, depending on the position of the general base. GH8a has the general base (Asp) at the N-terminal end of ?8 helix. GH8a contains cellulases, xylanases and other enzymes. In GH8b enzymes, the Asp residue is replaced by Asn, and the general base is a Glu residue located in a long loop inserted between ?7 and ?8 helices. GH8b contains chitosanases, licheninases, cellulases and other enzymes. The position of the general base in GH8c is unknown.

GH9 is the second largest cellulase family. It contains mainly endoglucanases with a few processive endoglucanases. All of the processive endoglucanases contain a family 3c CBM rigidly attached to the C-terminus of the GH9 catalytic domain (cd). This domain is part of the active site and is essential for processivity. CBM3c domains bind weakly to cellulose as they lack several of the conserved aromatic residues that are important for cellulose binding in family 3a and family 3b members. All known plant cellulases belong to GH9, and most of the other members are eubacterial although there are two archael members and some fungal, earthworm, arthropod, chordate, echinoderma and molusk members. There are two subgroups in GH9, E1 which contains only cellulases from bacteria, including ones from both aerobes and anaeobes, and E2 which includes some bacterial and all nonbacterial cellulases. An evolutionary study shows that the eucaryote members contain two monophyletic groups that are amcient; one including all animal members and the other including all plant members. All known processive endoglucanase genes are in subgroup E1. Most plant GH9 enzymes studied to date are endoglucanases (""cellulases"", EC 3.2.1.4) with little or no activity on crystalline cellulose, but with discernible activity on soluble cellulose derivatives, including carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), phosphoric acid swollen non-crystalline cellulose, and numerous plant polysaccharides including xylan, 1,3-1,4-ß-glucan, xyloglucan, and glucomannan. Due to their ubiquity and large numbers, the phylogeny of plant GH9 enzymes has been further sub-divided into three classes, which are described in detail on the plant GH9 endoglucanase subpage.";GH9 enzymes operate with inversion of anomeric stereochemistry. The processive endoglucanase, Cel9A from Thermobifda fusca, has high activity on bacterial cellulose and is the only cellulase tested that can degrade crystalline regions in bacterial cellulose by itself although it prefers amorphous regions. A related cellulase in Clostridium phytofermentans, which is the only family 9 cellulase encoded in its genome, has been shown to be essential for cellulose degradation by this organism. This is the only case where a single cellulase has been shown to be essential for growth on cellulose.;"There is a conserved Glu residue that functions as a catalytic general acid and two conserved Asp residues that bind the catalytic water, with one functioning as the catalytic general base; mutation of the other also greatly reduces activity on all substrates. Mutation of the conserved Glu to Ala, Gly or Gln reduced activity to less than >0.5% of WT on all forms of cellulose but the Ala and Gly mutant enzymes had higher than WT activity on dinitrophenyl-cellobioside which has a good leaving group, proving that this residue functions as the catalytic acid. Mutation of either of two conserved Asp residues that bound the catalytic water to Ala or Asn reduced activity to less then 2% of WT on all cellulosic substrates. However, only one of the Ala mutant enzymes showed azide rescue proving that it was the actual catalytic base.";All reported GH9 catalytic domain structures have an (a/a)6 barrel fold that contains an open active site cleft that contains at least six sugar binding subsites -4 to +2. In processive endoglucanases the catalytic domain is joined to a family 3c carbohydrate-binding module that is aligned with the active site cleft.;formerly known as cellulase family E.;none;(?/?)6;beta;inverting;syn;1rq5;cellobiohydrolase;Clostridium thermocellum;cellotetraose;Glu795;Asp383;[10]

Some of the latter display limited activity on aryl cellobiosides, but not on cellulose.;Family GH10 xylanases are retaining enzymes, as first shown by NMR and follow a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. Enzymes that have been well-studied kinetically include the Cellulomonas fimi endo-glycanase (Cex)*, for which a detailed kinetic study involving both steady state and pre-steady state kinetic analyses was performed. Recent studies of the roles of each substrate hydroxyl in catalysis have also been described. Detailed analyses of substrate and subsite specificities of the Pseudomonas cellulosa xylanase have also been described.;The catalytic nucleophile was first identified in the Cellulomonas fimi endo-xylanase (CfXyn10A) as Glu233 (earlier numbered as 274) in the sequence ITELD through trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping. The general acid/base residue was first identified as Glu127 in this same enzyme through detailed mechanistic analysis of mutants at that position, which included azide rescue experiments. Family GH10 enzymes, as is typical of Clan GHA, have an asparagine residue preceding the general acid/base residue in a typical NEP sequence. The asparagine engages in important hydrogen-bonding interactions with the substrate 2-hydroxyl.;Three-dimensional structures are available for a large number of Family GH10 enzymes, the first solved being those of the Streptomyces lividans xylanase A, the C. fimi endo-glycanase Cex, and the Cellvibrio japonicus Xyn10A (previously Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. xylanase A).

No detailed analyses involving both steady state and pre-steady state kinetic studies have been reported. However, recent studies of the contributions of each substrate hydroxyl to transition state stabilization, and thus to catalysis, have been reported.;The catalytic nucleophile was first identified in the Bacillus circulans endo-xylanase as Glu78 in the sequence ITELD through trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroxylobiosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping via LC-MS/MS technologies. The importance of the precise positioning of the nucleophile was probed by detailed kinetic analysis of mutants modified at that position. The general acid/base residue was first identified as Glu127 in this same enzyme through detailed mechanistic analysis of mutants at that position, which included azide rescue experiments. Indeed detailed analyses of the role of the general acid/base catalyst have been described. NMR measurements of changes in pKa values of enzymic residues during the catalytic cycle reveal pKa cycling, while the changes that occur upon repositioning or removing the general acid/base residue reveal its contributions.;Three-dimensional structures are available for several Family GH11 enzymes, the first solved being that of the Bacillus circulans xylanase.

Xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET, EC 2.4.1.207) activity has been observed in a single fungal GH12 member (GenBank AAN89225.1) using a XET-specific screen, although this may represent a side activity of a predominant xyloglucan endo-hydrolase.;GH12 enzymes are retaining enzymes, as first shown by NMR studies on endoglucanase 3 from Humicola insolens, and is believed to follow a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism in which a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed and subsequently this intermediate is hydrolysed via oxocarbenium-ion transition states. No detailed studies involving both steady state and pre-steady state kinetic have yet been reported for GH12.;The catalytic nucleophile and the general acid/base catalyst of GH12 enzymes was initialy predicted by sequence homology to the xylanase members of GH11, a glycoside hydrolase family where the catalytic nucleophile was first identified in the Bacillus circulans endo-xylanase through trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroxylobiosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping via LC-MS/MS technologies. GH11 and GH12 together form clan GH-C.

A number of reviews are concerned with ?-amylases. GH13 contains hydrolases, transglycosidases and isomerases; noticeably animal amino acid transporters, which have no glycosidase activity, are also GH13 members. The enzymes are found in a very wide range of organisms from all kingdoms. While known specificities are indicated by the enzyme named as listed below, for several of these numerous enzymes are characterized representing subspecificities defined by structural requirements for preferred substrates or the structure of the predominant product(s). Described enzymes include: ?-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1); oligo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.10); ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20); pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41); cyclomaltodextrinase (EC 3.2.1.54); maltotetraose-forming ?-amylase (EC 3.2.1.60); isoamylase (EC 3.2.1.68); dextran glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.70); trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.93); maltohexaose-forming ?-amylase (EC 3.2.1.98); maltotriose-forming ?-amylase (EC 3.2.1.116); maltogenic amylase (EC3.2.1.133); neopullulanase (EC 3.2.1.135); malto-oligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.141); limit dextrinase (EC3.2.1.142); maltopentaose-forming ?-amylase (EC 3.2.1.-); amylosucrase (EC 2.4.1.4); sucrose phosphorylase (EC2.4.1.7); branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18); cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) (EC 2.4.1.19); 4-?-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25); isomaltulose synthase (EC 5.4.99.11); trehalose synthase (EC 5.4.99.16). As mentioned above, heavy-chains of heteromeric amino acid transporters belong to the GH13. Among thousands of sequences and ~30 different enzymes specificities many are closely related to each other, GH13 therefore has officially been subdivided into almost 40 subfamilies; several subfamilies, e.g., the oligo-1,6-glucosidase and neopullulanase subfamilies were described earlier. Notably, a considerable number of GH13 members contain carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) referred to as starch binding domains belonging  to CBM20, CBM21, CBM25, CBM26, CBM34, CBM41, CBM45,CBM48, CBM53, and CBM58. The GH13 enzymes have a wide range of different preferred substrates and products. For example, the ?-amylases prefer polysaccharides of the ?-1,4-glucan type, such as amylose and amylopectin, but are also able to attack the supramolecular structures represented by starch granules and glycogen particles. Besides they have some significant albeit slower turn-over of maltooligosaccharides of a certain degree of polymerization. These typical substrate profiles can be manipulated through protein engineering. The ?-amylase family was defined in 1991 as family GH13 when the sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases was created. The ?-amylase family as an enzyme family, however, was established based on results of several independent findings focused on starch hydrolases and related enzymes. These enzymes were shown to exhibit sequence similarities and, at that time, a predicted (?/?)8-barrel (i.e. TIM-barrel) fold. The basic criteria for a protein to be a member of the ?-amylase family were as follows: the enzyme should (i) act on the ?-glucosidic linkages; (ii) hydrolyse or form by transglycosylation the ?-glucosidic linkages; (iii) contain the four conserved sequence regions in its amino acid sequence; and (iv) possess the catalytic triad formed by the three residues corresponding to Asp206, Glu230 and Asp297 of Taka-amylase A (the ?-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae). A dramatic increase of the number of GH13 members to several thousands offered a greater variety in both substrate and product specificities and sequence diversity so that the above criteria had to be updated. For example, also enzymes active on ?-1,1-, ?-1,2-, ?-1,3- and ?-1,5-glucosidic linkages belong to the ?-amylase family and the four best known and well-accepted conserved sequence regions, defined first for eleven ?-amylases, were completed by the additional three regions which can often help to assign the correct enzyme specificity of ?-amylase family members (for a review, see). Of note may be the enzyme neopullulanase that was found to catalyze both the hydrolysis of ?-1,4- and ?-1,6-glucosidic bonds as well as the transglycosylation to form these two types of glucosidic bonds. The ?-amylase family represents a clan GH-H of three glycoside hydrolase families GH13, GH70 and GH77, and should be distinguished from the second smaller ?-amylase family GH57. A remote homology to the family GH31 has also been discussed. The evolutionary relationships were described for the entire GH13 family and some closely related specificities, i.e. subfamilies, as well as many examples of close evolutionary relatedness were reported for the individual groups of ?-amylases, e.g., those from animals and actinomycetes, plants and archaeons, insects, and fungi. Exogenous and endogenous inhibitory proteins have also been reported from microorganisms and plants directed towards ?-amylases and limit dextrinases.";GH13 enzymes employ the retaining mechanism. This was first demonstrated by quantitative gas liquid chromatographic analysis of formation of ?-maltose from different maltosides and further supported by the NMR analysis of the release of ?-maltose from similar substrates. It was also demonstrated for a number of different ?-amylases that they follow the classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. This has moreover been supported by covalent labelling using 4-deoxy-maltotriose-fluoride trapping the catalytic nucleophile, numerous three-dimensional structures, and site-directed mutational substitution of the catalytic site residues. Some of the GH13 members use a multiple attack or processive mechanism involving several glycoside bond cleavages to be executed in the same enzyme-substrate encounter. In several cases the binding energies have been determined by using subsite mapping, which gives a subsite binding energy profile characteristic for individual enzymes. Several ?-amylases have been reported to interact with polymeric substrates at surface sites situated as a certain distance of the active site. Finally interaction with insoluble substrates, such as starch granules or glycogen can occur both at these sites as well as by the involvement of separate binding modules referred to as starch binding domains.;"The catalytic residues have been identified from early crystal structures. In fact throughout the family GH13 only the catalytic triad plus an arginine residue are totally conserved; the catalytic site includes an aspartate as catalytic nucleophile, a glutamate as general acid/base, and an aspartate that participates critically in stabilizing the transition state. The fourth invariantly conserved GH13 residue, the arginine, is positioned two residues preceding the catalytic nucleophile. This conservation does not apply for the enzymatically inactive heavy-chains (rBAT proteins and 4F2hc antigens) of the amino acid transporters. Numerous mutational analyses have been performed to confirm the essential roles of the three residues in catalysis, and normally the loss in activity is four to five orders of magnitude.";"Numerous GH13 subfamilies contain members for which a three-dimensional structure has been determined. In general, the GH13 members are multidomain proteins with catalytic (?/?)8-barrel (i.e. TIM-barrel) domain (called domain A) having a small domain B (usually varying in length and of irregular structure) inserted in the loop between the ?3-strand and ?3-helix of the barrel, and succeeded by the C-terminal antiparallel ?-sandwich domain, called domain C. The catalytic site formed by the C-terminal extensions of strands ?4, ?5 and ?7, carrying the catalytic triad of aspartate, glutamate and aspartate, respectively, but also other loops contribute to the overall architecture of the active site. The first crystals for barley ?-amylase were reported in the mid-forties, however the first crystal structures were those of TAKA-amylase A (PDB ID 2taa 7taa) and porcine pancreatic ?-amylase (PDB ID 1ppi). This was followed by structures of other ?-amylases from bacteria (PDB ID 1bpl 1bpl 1e43)and from higher plants (PDB ID1amy 1ht6); the industrially important cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (PDB ID 1cgt 1cdg 1pez) and the closely related maltogenic ?-amylase (PDB ID 1qhp). Later on the structures of the amylopectin debranching isoamylase (PDB ID 1bf2) and the related pullulanase (PDB ID 2fhf) and limit dextrinase (PDB ID 2y5e) were determined. Furthermore the oligo-1,6-glucosidase (PDB ID 1uok) and the related dextran glucosidase (PDB ID 2zic), as well as maltogenic amylase (PDB ID 1sma), cyclomaltodextrinase (PDB ID 1ea9) and neopullulanase (PDB ID1j0h) - nearly indistinguishable from each other - together with the neopullulanase-like “?-amylases” TVA I (PDB ID 1ji1) and TVA II (PDB ID 1bvz), and the amylosucrase (PDB ID 1g5a), sucrose phosphorylase (PDB ID 1r7a), sucrose hydrolase (PDB ID 1cze) and sucrose isomerase (PDB ID 1m53 1zja), were solved. Finally structures have been solved of glycogen branching (PDB ID 1m7x) and debranching (PDB ID 2vnc) enzymes. Among the solved structures are numerous site-directed-mutant and ligand-complexed forms. However, although there are structures available for most of the GH13 specificities, some still remain to be determined. Noticeably crystal structures are available of several ?-amylase/proteinaceous inhibitor complexes (for reviews, see).";many members have been assigned to subfamilies as described by Stam et al.

Some invertebrate GH16 proteins have lost their catalytic amino acids and are involved in immune response activation through the Toll pathway upon binding of ?-1,3 glucan.

This mechanistic analysis on bacterial mixed-linkage endo-glucanases has been reviewed in the broader context of GH16.;Several three-dimensional structures have been solved of family 16 members of archeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic origin.

A 1,3-?-D-glucan exohydrolase (EC 3.1.2.58) is also classified in this family. The family GH17 enzymes have quite distinct amino acid sequences and 3D structures compared with the 1,3-?-D-glucan endohydrolases and 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolases that have similar substrate specificities but are classified in familiesGH16, GH55, GH64 and GH81. The family GH17 1,3-?-D-glucan endohydrolases hydrolyse internal 1,3-?-D-glucosidic linkages in polysaccharides, but usually require a region of contiguous unbranched, un-substituted 1,3-?-D-glucosyl residues for activity. The enzymes release 1,3-?-D-oligoglucosides of DP 2-5 as their major products. Because the 1,3-?-D-glucan endohydrolases require a region of contiguous unbranched, unsubstituted 1,3-?-D-glucosyl residues for activity, they are unable to hydrolyse the single 1,3-?-D-glucosidic linkages in 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucans from the Poaceae, but they will hydrolyse 1,3-?-D-glucosidic linkages in fungal 1,3;1,6-?-D-glucans, provided an appropriate region of contiguous un-substituted 1,3-?-D-glucosyl residues is available. The family GH17 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolases (EC 3.1.2.73) hydrolyse 1,4-?-D-glucosidic linkages, but only 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucans in which the glucosyl residue involved in the glycosidic linkage cleaved is substituted at the C(0)3 position, that is, where the 1,4-?-D-glucosidic linkages are located on the reducing end side of 1,3-?-D-glucosyl residues. Reaction products released are mainly 1,3;1,4-?-D-tri- and tetrasaccharides (G4G3Gred and G4G4G3Gred), but they also release higher oligosaccharides of up to 10 or more contiguous 1,4-?-D-glucosyl residues with a single reducing terminal 1,3-?-D-glucosyl residue (e.g. G4G4G4G4G4G4G3Gred). These longer oligosaccharides originate from the longer regions of adjacent 1,4-linkages that account for approximately 10% by weight of 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucans in cell walls of the Poaceae.";"The stereochemistry of the reaction has been determined experimentally and catalysis by GH17 enzymes occurs via a classical Koshland retaining mechanism with the ?-anomeric configuration of the released oligosaccharide being retained. Detailed kinetic analyses are available for three purified barley 1,3-?-D-glucan endohydrolases and two barley 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolases.";"Active site labelling with epoxyalkyl ?-D-oligoglucoside inhibitors identified Glu231 and Glu232 as the catalytic nucleophiles of the barley 1,3- and 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolases, respectively, located at the bottom of, and about two-thirds of the way along the substrate binding cleft. The general acid/base residue of 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolase was initially identified as Glu288 by chemical labelling procedures, but this assignment was subsequently revised and Glu93 was proposed based on primary and tertiary structure similarity of GH17 enzymes with clan GH-A ?-glycosidases. The 5-6 ? distance between Glu232 and Glu93 is typical of retaining enzymes.";"The crystal structures of the barley 1,3-?-D-glucan endohydrolase isoenzyme GII and 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolase isoenzyme EII have been solved to 2.2-2.3 ? resolution and shown to adopt essentially identical (?/?)8 TIM barrel structures. The rms deviation in C? positions between the two barley enzymes is 0.65 ? for 278 residues. This indicates that only minor differences in structure and amino acid dispositions at the substrate-binding and catalytic sites are sufficient to change a pre-existing 1,3-?-D-glucan endohydrolase into a highly specific 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolase. A deep substrate-binding cleft extends across the surface of the enzyme and can accommodate 6-8 glucosyl-binding subsites. The open cleft enables the enzyme to bind at essentially any position along the 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan substrate and hence to hydrolyse internal glycoside linkages. Like in other clanGH-A structures, the general acid/base and catalytic nucleophile glutamates are positioned on strands ?-4 and ?-7. The X-ray crystallographic data provide compelling evidence that the 1,3;1,4-?-D-glucan endohydrolases of barley evolved via the recruitment of pre-existing and widely distributed family GH17 1,3-?-D-glucan endohydrolases. The similarities in substrate specificity between family GH17 and GH16 enzymes has arisen through convergent evolution; the family GH16 enzymes are members of clan-B and have a ?-jelly roll structure.";;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;predicted anti by clan;see e.g. at GH1;;;;;;
GH18;"chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14); endo-?-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.96); xylanase inhibitor; concanavalin B; narbonin";"Family GH18 is unusual in having glycoside hydrolases that are both catalytically active chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) and endo-?-N-acetylglucosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.96) and also sub-families of non-hydrolytic proteins that function as carbohydrate binding modules / ""lectins"" or as xylanase inhibitors. The active chitinases comprise non-processive endo-acting enzymes as well as processive enzymes with exo- and endo-binding preferences. Most enzymes primarily produce chitobiose, but some endo-acting family 18 chitinases are not capable to cleave trimers or tetramers and thus yield longer products. Note that in older literature the endo-/exo-character of these enzymes often is assessed by studying the degradation of oligomeric substrates, and that several recent studies have shown this method to be invalid. Family 18 chitinases break down all forms of chitin at varying rates depending on the enzyme and the substrate. They also act on chitosan with degrees of acetylation as low as 13 % and some are known to degrade peptidoglycan. Studies on family 18 chitinases from Serratia marcescens have suggested that most subsites for sugar binding show some promiscuity with the notable exception of subsite -1.";"GH18 enzymes perform enzymic catalysis with retention of anomeric configuration. They belong to a group of enzymes (including GH families 18, 20, 25, 56, 84, and 85) that perform catalysis using a double-displacement reaction but instead of the more common enzyme-derived nucleophile they utilize the N-acetamido carbonyl oxygen in what is termed neighboring group participation (or substrate participation or anchimeric assistance). Figures showing such a mechanism date back to Koshland's 1953 review; indeed they frequent the chemical literature of participating groups long before that, but it is primarily through the work on GH18 and soon after GH20 that such a mechanism became well established. In such a mechanism, which occurs with (net) retention of anomeric configuration, the enzyme provides a general acid function to protonate the leaving group to facilitate its departure with the substrate carbonyl oxygen playing the role of nucleophile to generate a bicyclic ""oxazolinium ion"" intermediate, which subsequently breaks down following the microscopic reverse via hydrolysis or occasionally transglycosylation). Such a mechanism has a number of facets, one of which is its potential inhibition using thiazolines. Allosamidin, a pseudotrisaccharide consisting of two N-acetylallosamine sugars linked to an allosamizoline moiety, is a well known natural compound that is a high affinity inhibitor of family 18 chitinases. Like in many other enzymes acting on polysaccharides the substrate-binding clefts of processive family 18 chitinases are lined with aromatic residues. Family 18 chitinases have proven very useful to gain insight into the structural basis of a processive mechanism and in the importance of such a mechanism for biomass-converting efficiency. As previously suggested for cellulases in e.g., aromatic residues close to the catalytic center play a crucial role in processivity.";"The catalytically-active GH18 enzymes use a double displacement reaction mechanism with neighboring group participation(see Figure). In this mechanism the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate acts as a nucleophile, with assistance from a carboxylate (Asp) that acts to deprotonate the N-acetamido nitrogen during oxazolinium ionformation/breakdown. A second catalytic acid residue (glutamate in family GH18, but often also Asp in other families using this mechanism, except for GH85 where this residue is an amide) acts as a general acid/base to protonate the glycosidic oxygen to assist in the departure of the aglycon, and to deprotonate the nucleophilic water molecule during the hydrolysis of the oxazolinium ion intermediate. In family GH18 the two catalytic carboxylates are found in an D-X-E motif whereas in other families the carboxylates may be adjacent, such as the DD motif in family GH84 (for example see). The physical separation of the two catalytic residues (with the second not in a position to act as a nucleophile itself) has led to confusion in some literature that GH18 and other enzymes (notably GH25) may be inverting enzymes; this is certainly not the case for GH18 and is unlikely to be the case for GH25. The D-X-E motif (Asp140-Glu144 in the Figure) is part of a diagnostic D-X-X-D-X-D-X-E motif that includes two more aspartates of which the one in italics (Asp140 in the Figure) is known to be essential for catalytic activity. There are several other conserved residues in the catalytic center that play important roles during catalysis, related to distortion of the -1 sugar, activation of the acetamido group and/or cycling of the pKa of the catalytic glutamate. The O6 of the –1 sugar interacts with the side chain of yet another semi-conserved aspartate (Asp215 in the Figure). In enzymes with an acidic pH optimum this residue is an asparagine";"Although these enzymes are frequently multi-modular, the catalytic domains are ? / ? barrels. While several structures for complete bi-modular chitinases are available (see Figure), available structural information for multi-modular enzymes is often limited to the isolated catalytic domain. Work on the conformational itinerary of catalysis which is extremely similar to other retaining enzymes active on gluco-configured substrates, was provided by the van Aalten group in 2001 through the trapping of a distorted Michaelis complex in 1,4B conformation and thus extremely similar to the 1S3 skew boats observed in GH5 for example or the 4E conformation originally seen for a ""neighboring group"" enzyme in GH20. More recently, a similar conformation has been observed for the Michaelis complex of another neighboring group enzyme, the GH84 O-GlcNAcase. Fungal GH18 enzymes are considered as possible therapeutic targets and a number of programmes are probing this area (for example).";"Contains chitinases of classes III and V.

GH19;"chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14); lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17)";"Glycoside hydrolases of family 19 are endo-acting enzymes that hydrolyze glycosidic bonds within chitin, an insoluble polymer of ?-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and are thus referred to as chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14). These enzymes were originally identified in plants. In an older classification system for plant chitinases, comprising both GH18 and GH19 chitinases, family 19 enzymes comprise classes I, II and IV. In 1996, the first bacterial family 19 chitinase was described. In addition to cleaving chitin, GH19 chitinases cleave soluble oligomers of ?-1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. For some plant enzymes lysozyme activity has been demonstrated. Currently available data suggest that GH19 enzymes are not particularly effective in degrading crystalline chitin (compared to certain members of the GH18 chitinase family), especially enzymes that lack CBMs. On the other hand GH19 enzymes are highly active on chitosans (= partially deacetylated chitin) with high degrees of acetylation, even if they lack a CBM. Detailed studies on GH19 chitinases from Streptomyces (class IV;) and rice (Oryza sativa; Class I;) have revealed that productive binding requires a GlcNAc to be bound in subsites -2 and +1, whereas deacetylated GlcNAc (GlcN) is tolerated in subsites -1 and +2.";Family 19 enzymes employ an inverting mechanism, as determined by NMR and HPLC analysis[6]. Both structural characteristics (see below) and available biochemical data suggest that GH19 chitinases are non-processive endo-acting enzymes. Kinetic data for the conversion of polymeric and oligomeric substrates have been described in several studies. In some studies, kinetic data have been used to derive subsite binding affinties (e.g.).;The catalytic residues are two glutamates. Although there still is limited structural information underpinning details of the inverting catalytic mechanism, there is considerable support for the notion that a glutamate located at the end of the third alpha helix (Glu 67 in the barley enzyme) acts as the catalytic general acid, whereas another glutamate located in a more variable loop-like structure (Glu89 in the barley enzyme) acts as the catalytic general base[9, 11, 12, 13]. It has been shown that at least two more conserved charged residues are crucial for catalysis. These residues, Glu203 and Arg215 in barley chitinase, form a triad together with the catalytic acid Glu67 (see Figure). Interestingly, a similarly complex electrostatic interaction network is present in family GH46 chitosanases with whom the family 19 enzymes share some overall structural similarity (see below);"The catalytic domains of family 19 chitinases have a lysozyme-like fold with rather shallow substrate-binding grooves that are not particularly rich in aromatic residues (see Figure). The catalytic domains of family 19 chitinases share a common fold with family GH46 chitosanases and with lysozymes in families GH22, GH23 and GH24 of glycoside hydrolases. For a long time, structural information for these chitinases was limited to the structures of two class II plant enzymes. Recently, the structures of bacterial family GH19 chitinases have become available ([13, 19]; class IV), as well as the structures of class I and class IV GH19 chitinases from plants. The structures of bacterial GH19 chitinases revealed several differences from the previously reported plant structures ([13, 19]; see Figure). Compared to plant enzymes, the bacterial enzymes lack a C-terminal extension and three loops, some of which are thought to be flexible. There is no structural information for GH19 enzymes in complex with their substrate. In 2008, Huet et al published the structure of a complex of papaya family 19 chitinase with GlcNAc units bound in the -2 and +1 subsites. This structure has been used to build a plausible model of a complex with (GlcNAc)4. This is the first structure (half experimental, half modeled) of an enzyme-substrate complex.";Contains chitinases of classes I, II, and IV.;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition to exo-acting ?-N-acetylglucosaminidases, ?-N-acetylgalactosamindase and ?-6-SO3-N-acetylglucosaminidases, GH20 also contains exo-acting lacto-N-biosidases that cleave ?-D-Gal-(1?3)-D-GlcNAc disaccharides from the non-reducing end of oligosaccharides. The best known members of GH20 are the human isoenzymes hexosaminidase A (a heterodimer of ? and ? subunits) and B (a homodimer of ? subunits), which are responsible for the hydrolysis of the terminal GalNAc residue from the GM2 ganglioside (GalNAc?(1–4)-[NANA?(2–3)-]-Gal?(1–4)-Glc-ceramide) within the lysosome. Mutations to these enzymes are responsible for the lysosomal storage disorders Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA) and Sandhoff disease (HEXB). Inhibitors of these enzymes are being developed as chemical chaperones to promote the partial restoration of enzyme activity in vivo and treat these genetic disorders.;"GH20 enzymes are retaining glycoside hydrolases. Neighboring group participation has long been established as a reasonable mechanism for glycoside hydrolysis in solution[3, 4, 5, 6] and originally outlined as a possible, though subsequently refuted, mechanism for the hen egg-white lysozyme-catalyzed cleavage of ?-aryl di-N-acetylchitobiosides. The earliest kinetic evidence supporting a mechanism involving neighboring group participation in an enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis can be found for an N-acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidase isolated from Aspergillus oryzae, likely a GH20 enzyme. This work used free energy relationships to infer neighbouring group participation although complete Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters were not determined. Such kinetic parameters were determined for a ?-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Aspergillus niger and a similar free energy relationship-based analysis carried out to infer neighbouring group participation for this enzyme which, though unknown, is likely from GH20. The potency of ""NAG-thiazoline"" as a competitive inhibitor of the jack bean (Canavalia spp) N-acetyl-?-D-hexosaminidase (Ki = 280 nM) has also been used to infer neighboring group participation in the catalytic mechanism although, interestingly, the only retaining hexosaminidases reported currently (November 2010) in the CAZy database for the genus Canavalia are found in GH18. Deacetylation of the non-reducing end of a series of chito-oligosaccharides results in a loss of activity of Serratia marscescenschitobiase, an established GH20 enzyme, towards these compounds, which instead act as competitive inhibitors. Moreover the structure of Serratia marcescens chitobiase in complex with a substrate provides structural support for a substrate-assisted mechanism. A comparative analysis of the activity of Streptomyces plicatus ?-hexosaminidase (SpHex, GH20) and Vibrio furnisii ?-hexosaminidase (ExoII, GH3) towards p-nitrophenyl N-acyl glucosaminides highlights contrasting reactivity trends expected for families of ?-glucosaminidase utilizing a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis (GH20) and those which do not (GH3): sharp decreases in activity with increasing N-acyl fluorination are observed in the case of the SpHex enzyme whereas negligible changes in activity are observed for ExoII.";The key catalytic residues of GH20 enzymes are found in a conserved D-E amino acid pair. This catalytic diad is preceded in the primary sequence by the consensus H-x-G-G motif. The glutamate residue functions as the catalytic general acid/base. As these enzymes employ neighbouring group participation the preceding aspartate is not a nucleophile. Rather kinetic and crystallographic studies have shown that this residue orients and polarizes the N-acetyl residue. It may function either as a general base by deprotonating the N-acetyl group in the intermediate and forming a neutral oxazoline intermediate, or alternatively it may electrostatically stabilize a positively charge oxazolinium ion intermediate. The N-acetyl group of the substrate is bound in a hydrophobic pocket defined by three conserved tryptophan residues. These three tryptophan residues define a compact pocket which does not accommodate (non-native) extended N-acyl side-chains as readily as the elongated hydrophobic pocket found in GH84 enzymes.;The first GH20 enzyme to have its structure determined was the Serratia marscescens chitobiase. This enzyme's active site is located at the C-terminal end of the third of four protein domains, a (??)8-barrel. On the basis of a structure of this enzyme in complex with the substrate chitobiose, the invariant Glu540 was identified as the likely catalytic general acid/base. Furthermore the N-acetyl group of the non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine residue was found to have its carbonyl oxygen atom suitably positioned to act as the nucleophile.;;K;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;1c7s;chitobiase;Serratia marcescens;chitobiose;Glu540;internal;[19]

GH23;"lysozyme type G (EC 3.2.1.17); peptidoglycan lyase (EC 4.2.2.-) also known in the literature as peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylase";"The glycoside hydrolases of this family are lytic transglycosylases (also referred to as peptidoglycan lyases) of both bacterial and bacteriophage origin, and family G lysozymes (EC 3.2.1.17; muramidase, peptidoglycan N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase, 1,4-?-N-acetylmuramidase, N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase) of eukaryotic origin. Both of these enzymes are active on peptidoglycan, but only the lysozymes are active on chitin and chitooligosaccharides. No other activities have been observed. The lytic transglycosylases of GH23 constitute Family 1 of the organizational scheme of Blackburn and Clarke. This family has been subdivided into five subfamilies (1A-1E) with Escherichia coli soluble lytic transglycosylase 70 (Slt70), membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase C (MltC), MltE, MltD, and MltF (formerly, YfhD) serving as the prototypes for families 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1E, respectively.";The enzymes of this family cleave the ?-1,4-linkage between N-acetylmuramyl and N-acetylglucosaminyl residues in peptidoglycan (Figure 1). Only the lysozymes of this family are capable of releasing N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues from chitodextrins, and neither catalyze transglycosylation reactions. The stereochemistry of the reaction catalysed by the family G lysozymes has been determined experimentally as inverting. On the other hand, the lytic transglycosidases, strictly speaking, are retaining enzymes. However, unlike lysozyme, they are not hydrolases but rather catalyse an intramolecular transglycosylation to the C-6 hydroxyl group of the muramyl residue leading to the generation of a terminal 1,6-anhydromuramic acid product that is an acetal, and not a hemiacetal. The lytic transglycosylases require the peptide side chains in peptidoglycan for activity, accounting for their inactivity against chitin or chitooligosaccharides. No detailed analyses involving both steady-state and pre-steady state kinetic studies have been reported.;Until recently, the family GH23 enzymes were thought to have only a single catalytic residue at their active centre. The identity of the catalytic general acid/base residue of the lysozymes was first inferred by X-ray crystallography of goose egg-white lysozyme (GEWL) as Glu73. Likewise, analysis of the crystal structure of E. coli Slt70 identified Glu as the lone catalytic residue[7]. Replacement of each respective residue results in loss of catalytic activity. The mechanism of action of the family GH23 enzymes has yet to be proven experimentally, but examination of crystal structures and theoretical considerations have led to separate proposals for the two classes of enzymes. With the lytic transglycosylases, there is still no evidence for a second catalytic residue at their active sites. Hence, based on the complexes formed with 1,6-anhydromuropeptide or bulgecin, a two-step mechanism that uses neighboring group participation (also termed substrate assisted catalysis), analogous to the family GH18 chitinases and chitobiases and family GH20 N-acetyl-?-hexosaminidases, has been invoked. Thus, in the first step the Glu73 residue is proposed to serve initially as a general acid to donate a proton to the glycosidic oxygen of the linkage (Figure 2). At the same time anchimeric assistance by the MurNAc 2-acetamido group results in the formation an oxazolinium ion intermediate. In the second step Glu73 acts as a general base to abstract the proton from the C-6 hydroxyl leading to its nucleophilic attack on the anomeric centre and the formation of 1,6-anhydromuramic acid product. The transition states leading to and from the intermediate possess oxocarbenium ion character (Figure 2). For the g-type lysozymes, recent studies support a typical inverting mechanism of action involving general acid andgeneral base residues. It was proposed that two catalytic general base residues, a primary and a secondary residue, position a catalytic water molecule and abstract a proton to effect substrate hydrolysis by the single displacement mechanism. With GEWL, Asp97 and Asp86, respectively, are proposed to serve this function while these would be represented by the conserved Asp101 and Asp90 residues in the g-type lysozyme from Atlantic cod fish. Indeed, the double replacement of Asp101 and Asp90 in the cod lysozyme results in over a 300-fold decrease in activity.;"Three-dimensional structures are available for several Family GH23 enzymes, the first solved being that of GEWL. The catalytic domain of each enzyme possesses the well characterized ?+? ""lysozyme fold"" for avian lysozymes. However, there are distinct structural differences between the two classes of enzymes. Most notably, the environment of the active site in lytic transglycosylases, particularly around the catalytic acid/base, is more hydrophobic compared to that of GEWL. This distinction may account for the difference in the reaction mechanisms of the two enzymes.";"Corresponds to family 1 of the peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylases described by N.T.

GH25;lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17);Glycoside hydrolases of family GH25 are lysozymes otherwise known as the Chalaropsis (CH) type of lysozymes (from their initial characterisation from Chalaropsis species of fungus). They cleave the ?-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) in the carbohydrate backbone of bacterial peptidoglycan. The characterized lysozymes from this family exhibit both ?-1,4-N-acetyl- and ?-1,4-N,6-O-diacetylmuramidase activities and are able to degrade O-acetylated peptidoglycan present in Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogens. The activity of GH25 enzymes appears to fulfil two main biological roles in bacteria. These roles are the re-modelling of peptidoglycan in cellular process such as division and the dissemination of phage progeny toward the end of the phage lytic cycle, which is achieved by lysis of the bacterial cell. For this reason many GH25 proteins are found to be chromosomal, phage or prophage encoded. The majority of the GH25 family is comprised of bacterial or prokaryotic viral (phage) members. There are however a few eukaryotic representatives, but these are so far restricted to the fungal kingdom. The roles of these fungal enzymes are less clear, many possess signal secretion peptides indicating a likely extracellular location, possibly for the purpose of obtaining or gaining assess to nutrients or even as a selective agent against bacteria.;The lack of activity on chitooligosaccharides and the difficulty of producing defined synthetic peptidoglycan substrates, has inevitably hampered the determination of kinetic parameters. Structural studies have shown the active-centre is closely similar to those from GH18, GH20, GH56, GH84 and GH85 implying that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, GH25 enzymes are retaining glycoside hydrolases that use a neighboring group participation mechanism common to this “super-family” of enzymes.;The super-family comprised of families GH18, GH20, GH56, GH84 and GH85 has been shown to use an active site DE or DXE sequence motif (or exceptionally in the case of GH85 a NXD motif). This carboxylate pair promotes a double displacement mechanism in which the catalytic nucleophile is not enzyme-derived but is provided by the substrate in an intramolecular “neighboring group” attack of the N-acetyl carbonyl group. Thus catalysis occurs via the formation, and subsequent breakdown of a covalent oxazoline (or oxazolinium ion) intermediate.;So far four members of this family of enzymes have been structural characterized, that of the Streptomyces coelicolor enzyme “cellosyl”, the bacteriophage lysine PlyB, and Clp-1lysozyme from a Streptococcus pneumoniae phage, whose structure was also obtained in complex with fragments of peptidoglycan analogues 10 and BaGh25c from Bacillus anthracis str. Ames. The GH25 lysozymes, are structurally unrelated to the GH22, GH23, GH24, GH73 and GH108 lysozyme folds and instead these enzymes display a modified ? -barrel-like fold that, like the classical “TIM-barrel” is composed of a eight-stranded ?-barrel, but which is flanked by just three (as opposed to the normal eight) ?-helices. There is a prominent, long groove, very likely the substrate binding site, located on the C-terminal face. This groove culminates in a deep hole of a highly negative electrostatic potential forming the catalytic site.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GH26;"?-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78); ?-1,3-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.32)";Glycoside hydrolases of family 26 are primarily of endo-?-1,4-mannanases, although a recent exo-acting ?-mannanase has been described. The family also contains enzymes that display ?-1,3:1,4-glucanase and ?-1,3-xylanase activities.;"Family GH26 enzymes utlize a retaining mechanism, as shown by NMR and follow a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. Pre-steady state kinetics using activated substrates revealed the two phases of the reaction; the rapid initial glycosylation step (only with good leaving groups) followed by the slower deglycosylation. It should be noted that the use of substrates with a good leaving group result in a very low apparent KM, particularly with the acid-base mutant. This does not reflect tight affinity but simply that the glycosylation step (k2) is much quicker than the deglycosylation step (k3).";"The catalytic residues were first identified in the endo-?-1,4-mannanase CjMan26A. The general acid/base residue is the glutamate Glu320, which is separated in sequence by ~100 residues from the catalytic nucleophile, Glu212. The catalytic nucleophile was identified by site-directed mutagenesis in harness with the kinetics of 2,4-dintrophenyl-?-mannobioside hydrolysis which, although very slow was associated with a dramatic decrease in KM. The identity of the catalytic nucleophile was also revealed through site-directed mutagenesis and its function was visualized by X-ray crystallography in the acid-base mutant of which the glycosyl enzyme intermediate bound to 2-deoxy-2-fluoromannose was formed. In Clan GHA, of which GH26 is a member, the residue immediately preceding the general acid/base residue in sequence is an asparagine that makes pivotal interactions with the 2-hydroxyl of the substrate. In GH26 the equivalent amino acid is a histidine, His211 in CjMan26A, although its function is conserved; it also makes important interactions with the 2-hydroxyl of the substrate.";Three-dimensional structures are available for a large number of Family GH26 enzymes, the first solved being that of the Cellvibrio japonicus (previously called various names in the genus Pseudomonas) mannanase CjMan26A. As members of Clan GHA they have a classical (?/?)8 TIM barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids located at the C-terminal ends of ?-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile). The crystal structure of two C. japonicus mannanases in complex with activated substrates with the acid base mutant, or substrates that are very slowly hydrolyzed in the wild type enzyme, show that catalysis by this class of enzyme proceeds via a Boat2,5 (B2,5) transition state, whereas the GH26 ?-1,3:1,4-glucanase transition state adopts a half-chair 4H3 conformation. The chemical rationale for the different transition states adopted by ?-mannanases and glucanases is discussed by Davies and colleagues in these publications and elsewhere.

GH27;"?-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22); ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49); isomalto-dextranase (EC 3.2.1.94); ?-L-arabinopyranosidase (EC 3.2.1.88)";Glycoside hydrolases of family 27 possess a range of activities. ?-Galactosidase activity has been observed in both bacterial and eukaryotic members of GH27, whereas ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity has been observed in certain eukaryotic enzymes, including human, mouse, and chicken. Bacterial GH27 isomaltodextranases have also been identified. Notably, this family contains both human ?-galactosidase A and human ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (also known as ?-galactosidase B), defects in which produce the phenotypes associated with Fabry and Schindler lysosomal storage disorders, respectively. Guided by protein tertiary structural analysis (vide infra), the substrate specificities of the human ?-galactosidase A and human ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase have been interconverted by protein engineering.;"Family GH27 ?-galactosidases are anomeric configuration-retaining enzymes, as first demonstrated by proton NMR studies of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl ?-galactopyranoside by an ?-galactosidase isolated from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. GH27 enzymes are thus expected to use a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism, which involves the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. As predicted based on their common clanship in Clan GH-D, Glycoside Hydrolase Family 36 (GH36) enzymes also operate through the same ""retaining"" mechanism.";"The conserved amino acid sidechain that functions as the catalytic nucleophile in GH27 has been identified in two different eukaryotic family members by mechanism-based labelling, proteolytic digestion, and mass spectrometric analysis. Identification of Asp-130 in the YLKYDNC sequence fragment of the Phanerochaete chrysosporium ?-galactosidase by labelling with 2',4',6'-trinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-?-D-lyxo-hexopyranoside (""2,2-difluoro-?-galactosyl picrate"") only slightly predated the identification of the same conserved aspartate in the green coffee bean ?-galactosidase (Asp-145 in the sequence LKYDNCNNN) using 5-fluoro-?-D-galactopyranosyl fluoride as a labelling agent. The subsequent observation of a trapped covalent 2-deoxy-2,2-difluorogalactosyl-enzyme intermediate human (Homo sapiens) ?-galactosidase A on Asp170 of that enzyme provided further ""visual"" confirmation of the identity of the catalytic nucleophile in this family. The general acid/base residue in this family was first identified by X-ray structural analysis of the chicken (Gallus gallus) N-acetylgalactosaminidase in complex with N-acetylgalactosamine. The position of the product within the enzyme active site indicated that Asp-201 in the sequence CNLWRNYDDIQDSW was the obvious candidate to fulfill this role. Subsequent product complexes of the rice ?-galactosidase, human ?-galactosidase A, and the Hypocrea jecorina (née Trichoderma reesei) ?-galactosidase have similarly implicated the homologous residue in these enzymes in catalysis. Interestingly, of the over 200 known point mutations in human ?-galactosidase A that lead to Fabry disease, very few involve the catalytic residues. While many mutations are thought to disrupt the hydrophobic core of the enzyme or otherwise disrupt protein folding, only the D170V, D170H, and D231N genotypic variants are known, with obvious catalytic implications. Several other mutations are known to affect key active site structural or substrate-binding residues in human ?-galactosidase A. Whereas Fabry disease is X-linked and therefore comparatively more common, the autosomal recessive Schindler disease is rare. Comparative analysis using the structurally similar human ?-galactosidase A and chicken N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzymes has indicated that none of the few known mutations in the human GH27 N-acetylgalactosaminidase occur in the catalytic nor active site residues.";Published in 2002, the 3-D structure of the chicken (Gallus gallus) N-acetylgalactosaminidase solved by Garman et al. using X-ray crystallography (1.9 ? resolution) represented the first structure of an enzyme from GH27, and indeed Clan GH-D. Futhermore, the simultaneous solution of an enzyme-product complex (2.4 ?), was instrumental in defining the catalytic acid/base residue in this GH family and clan, as described above. Soon thereafter, structures of the rice (Oryza sativa) ?-galactosidase (2003), human (Homo sapiens) ?-galactosidase A (2004), and Hypocrea jecorina (née Trichoderma reesei) ?-galactosidase (2004) were presented in both free and product-complexed forms. All of these structures indicated that GH27 enzymes are comprised of an N-terminal (?/?)8 (TIM) barrel domain and a C-terminal anti-parallel ?-jellyroll domain, the former of which contains the enzyme catalytic center composed by loop residues at the ends of ? strands 1-7. In 2010, Garman and co-workers published an ensemble of tertiary structures of the human ?-galactosidase A, which included a trapped covalent 2-deoxy-2,2-difluorogalactosyl-enzyme intermediate in an 1S3 skew boat conformation. Together with native, substrate-bound (E•S, Michaelis complex), and product-bound (E•P) structures, this work provided the first complete analysis of substrate distortion along the enzyme reaction coordinate in GH27. Thus, GH27 enzymes use a 4C1 ? (4H3)‡ ? 1S3 ? (4H3)‡ ? 4C1 conformational itinerary. This is the same itinerary employed by GH31 enzymes (also of Clan GH-D, vide infra), while the ?-L-fucosidases of GH29 use the mirror-image itinerary: 1C4 ? (3H4)‡ ? 3S1 ? (3H4)‡? 1C4 (see for a full discussion). The known overall structures of GH27 enzymes are all highly conserved and the N-terminal domains are all closely superimposable, with minor exceptions including the H. jecorina (T. reesei) ?-galactosidase, which contains a 40 amino acid insertion in loop ?4-?4, and the animal enzymes, which contain a short 10 residue insertion in the ?1-?1 loop. The C-terminal domains, although similar, are less well conserved, both at the primary and tertiary structural levels. In keeping with the exo mode of action of these enzymes, which cleave ?-Gal from the non-reducing termini of their substrates, the active sites are pocket-shaped. Specificity for the 2-hydroxyl substituent, in the case of ?-galactosidases in the family, and the 2-deoxy-2-N-acetyl substituent, in the case of the ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidases, is dictated by the presence of correspondingly large or small active-site binding residues, respectively (reviewed in). Based on these observations, phylogenetic analysis has been presented which may have some power to predict specificity within GH27. As predicted by their common membership in Clan GH-D, GH36 enzymes likewise present active sites on (?/?)8 barrel domains. GH36 enzymes also contain a related C-terminal ?-sheet domain, in addition to a large ?-supersandwich N-terminal domain not found in GH27 enzymes. Structural analysis of a GH31 enzyme has led to the addition of this family to Clan GH-D.;Mechanistic commonality with family GH36 demonstrated by Comfort et al.

GH28;"polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15); exo-polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.67); exo-polygalacturonosidase (EC 3.2.1.82); rhamnogalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.171); endo-xylogalacturonan hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.-); rhamnogalacturonan ?-L-rhamnopyranohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.40)";The overwhelming majority of glycoside hydrolases of this family are polygalacturonases. They hydrolyse the ?-1,4 glycosidic linkage between galacturonate residues in polygalacturonic acid. Both endo and exo acting polygalacturonases are represented. Polygalacturonic acid, with varying degrees of C6 methylation and acetylation, forms the smooth homogalacturonan region of pectin. There are also some enzymes in this family active against rhamnogalacturonan which forms the branched part of the pectin molecule. Rhamnogalacturonases cleave the ?-1,2 linkage between galacturonic acid and rhamnose residues. Two other enzymes rhamnohydrolase and rhamnogalacturonan galacturonohydrolase cleave off single terminal carbohydrate units, rhamnose and galacturonate respectively, from the non-reducing end of rhamnogalacturonan.;"Family GH28 enzymes follow an inverting mechanism; they harness a single displacement mechanism as revealed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy of the products of hydrolysis in D2O reaction mixtures. Subsequently, the rhamnogalacturonases were also shown to invert the configuration of the newly formed reducing end of the polysaccharide.";The crystal structure of rhamnogalacturonase revealed a cluster of aspartates involved in catalysis. It was subsequently realised that protonation of the glycosidic oxygen and nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon may be from the same side of the bond in ?-linked polysaccharides rather than opposite sides with a resulting shorter separation of carboxylates than standard for cleaving substrates with ?-linkages explaining the short spacing between the conserved carboxylates in the GH28 hydrolases. These authors identified Asp202, Asp223 and Asp224 as the catalytic residues. The clearest assignment of the role of the catalytic residues comes from the work of van Santen et al based on the results of mutagenesis and comparison with phage 22 tailspike protein. Asp201 (Asp223) is proposed to act as the general acid residue (proton donor), whereas Asp180 (Asp202) and Asp202 (Asp224) are general bases that activate the nucleophilic water molecule (numbers are given for Aspergillus niger and in parantheses for Ewinia carotovora polygalacturonase).;The structure of rhamnogalacturonase (RGase A) from Aspergillus aculeatus revealed the signature parallel ?-helix architecture common to several pectin active enzymes including family 1 pectate lyases. The GH28 enzymes are distinguished from the lyases by having four, not three, parallel ?-sheets extending along their longitudinal axes. Compared to rhamnogalacturonase, polygalacturonase lacks the C-terminal turn of ?-helix having ten tuns, not eleven. The structure of exopolygalacturonase from Yersinia enterocolitica shows how amino acid inserts close off the open substrate binding cleft of endopolygalacturonase to form an exopolygalacturonase.;;N;?-helix;alpha;inverting;anti;2uvf;exo-polygalacturonosidase;Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC9610D;digalacturonic acid;Asp402;Asp381 Asp403;[25]
GH29;?-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51);The glycoside hydrolases of this family are exo-acting ?-fucosidases from archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic origin. No other activities have been observed for GH29 family members. So far the only other CAZY family containing ?-fucosidases is family GH95. The human enzyme FucA1 is of medical interest because its deficiency leads to fucosidosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease.;GH29 ?-fucosidases are retaining enzymes following a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism, as first proposed in 1987 for human liver ?-fucosidase via burst kinetics experiments and using methanol as an alternative glycone acceptor to produce methyl ?-L-fucoside. This has been further confirmed by 1H NMR monitoring of the reaction catalyzed by an ?-L-fucosidase from Thermus sp., and a ?-L-fucosidase from the marine mollusc Pecten maximus, as well as by COSY and 1H-13C NMR spectroscopy analysis of the interglycosidic linkage of disaccharides formed by the transglycosylation action of Sulfolobus solfataricus ?-L-fucosidase, Ss?-fuc. GH95 ?-fucosidases, in contrast, operate with inversion of the anomeric configuration.;The catalytic nucleophile in GH29 was first identified in the Sulfolobus solfataricus ?-L-fucosidase, Ss?-fuc, as Asp242 in the sequence VYFDWWI via chemical rescue of an inactive mutant with sodium azide. Concomitantly the catalytic nucleophile of Thermotoga maritima ?-L-fucosidase, Tm?-fuc, was confirmed to be Asp224 in the sequence LWNDMGW through trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping via LC-MS/MS technologies, as well as by chemical rescue of an inactive mutant. The trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucosyl-enzyme intermediate in Tm?-fuc was corroborated by crystallographic studies. The catalytic nucleophile of the human enzyme FucA1 has recently been identified as being Asp225. Whereas the catalytic nucleophile in GH29 has been shown to be a conserved aspartate residue, the identity of the general acid/base is still controversial. Structural and mutagenesis studies of Tm?-fuc provided strong evidence for the variant Glu266 being the general acid/base. In the crystal structure the carboxyl function of this residue is 5.5 ? away from that of the catalytic nucleophile Asp224, a distance commonly observed in retaining glycosidases proceeding via a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. Although multiple sequence alignments show that Glu266 is not conserved within GH29, the residue is structurally conserved in two 3-D structures of ?-L-fucosidases from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, recently deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession numbers 3eyp and 3gza). Studies of Ss?-fuc demonstrated that mutation of the Glu residue corresponding in sequence to Tm?-fuc Glu266 barely impaired the catalytic activity of the enzyme, whereas a Glu58Gly mutant had a 4000 fold lowerkcat/KM and could be chemically rescued. In the crystal structure of Tm?-fuc in complex with fucose, the residue corresponding to Ss?-fuc Glu58, Glu66, is found 7.5 ? away from the catalytic nucleophile Asp224 and hydrogen bonded to the C-3 hydroxyl group of fucose, which altogether makes this residue an unlikely candidate for the function of the general acid/base. A recent study of the human ?-L-fucosidase FucA1, carefully done combining bioinformatics, structural modelling, mutagenesis, chemical rescue with azide and 1H NMR spectral analysis, identified Glu289 as the general acid/base. The equivalent residue in Tm?-fuc, Glu281, as inferred from sequence alignment of FucA1 and Tm?-fuc, points to the interior of the (?/?)8barrel and lies about 15 ? apart form the catalytic centre. Altogether it appears that family GH29 is a quite exceptional CAZy family in that multiple sequence alignments do not allow an unambiguous assignment of the general acid/base.;Very few structures are available for GH29 enzymes. The first crystal structure to be solved is that of the ?-L-fucosidase from T. maritima, Tm?-fuc (PDB ID 1hl8). The simultaneous solution of the structures of an enzyme-product complex (PDB ID 1odu) and of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (PDB ID 1hl9) allowed the unambiguous identification of the general acid/base, as described above. Tm?-fuc assembles as a hexamer and displays a two-domain fold, composed of a catalytic (?/?)8-like domain and a C-terminal ?-sandwich domain. The two key active site residues are located at the C-terminal ends of strands ?-strands 4 (nucleophile) and 6 (acid/base). Crystallization experiments for the S. solfataricus ?-L-fucosidase, Ss?-fuc, were not very fruitful, but a small angle scattering study has been reported, which suggests a nonameric assembly of the enzyme in solution. Two crystal structures, arising from Structural Genomics initiatives, have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank for ?-L-fucosidases from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, with accession numbers 3eyp and 3gza. The catalytic domain of Tm?-fuc does not adopt the canonical TIM-barrel (?/?)8fold, as it lacks helices ?5 and ?6. Helix ?5 is also missing in the structure of one of the B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 ?-L-fucosidases, BT3798 (PDB ID 3gza), whereas ?-L-fucosidase BT2192 (PDB ID 3eyp) from the same organism adopts the canonical TIM-barrel fold. The three structures differ furthermore by the insertion/deletion of a considerable number of additional ?-helices, 310 helices, and extended surface loop regions. The closest structural homologues of GH29 enzymes within the CAZy classification can be found in families GH13 and GH27.;Transglycosylation activity had been observed in 1987 for human liver ?-fucosidase. The first successful transformation of an ?-fucosidase into an ?-transfucosidase by directed evolution has been reported for Thermotoga maritima ?-fucosidase. ?-Fucosidases mutated in the catalytic nucleophile from both Sulfolobus solfataricus and Thermotoga maritima were successfully transformed into a type of synthetic enzyme termed a 'glycosynthase', in this case a fucosynthase, which use ?-L-fucopyranosyl azide as donor substrate.;none;(?/?)8;alpha;retaining;syn;1hl9;?-l-fucosidase;Thermotoga maritima;2-F-fuco- pyranosyl;Glu266;Asp224;[26]

This family currently contains enzymes from only bacteria and eukaryotes. The best-studied enzyme is human ?-glucocerebrosidase whose deficiency causes Gauchers disease. This enzyme is responsible for hydrolyzing the ?-glucoside from the glycolipid glucosylceramide.;Family GH30 enzymes are retaining enzymes. Although this has never been formally demonstrated experimentally through NMR analysis of the initially formed sugar product, covalent trapping of the catalytic nucleophile (described below) conclusively demonstrates that these enzymes follow the classic Koshland double-displacement mechanism. The ?-glucosylceramidases require an activator protein and negatively charged phospholipids for optimal activity, although the role of these activators is still not entirely clear. Neither the ?-1,6-glucanases nor the ?-xylosidases appear to require any activators.;The catalytic nucleophile was first identified in human ?-glucocerebrosidase as Glu340 in the sequence FASEA by trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping by LC/MS-MS. The catalytic nucleophile had been previously been mistakenly identified as Asp443 using a tritiated bromoconduritol epoxide, although subsequent kinetic analyses of site-directed mutants of Asp443 were not consistent with its role as the catalytic nucleophile. The general acid/base residue of human ?-glucoerebrosidase is predicted to be Glu-274. While this identification has not been experimentally verified through analysis of variant proteins created by mutation of that site, it is consistent with structural studies (below).;The three-dimensional structure of human ?-glucocerebrosidase was first solved in 2003, and since then several different structures of this enzyme have been reported (reviewed in). GH30 enzymes are members of the GHA clan fold, consistent with the classic (?/?)8 TIM barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids located at the C-terminal ends of ?-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile).;The family classification of a number of GH30 members was revised in 2010. In several studies concerning glucuronoxylan xylanohydrolases previously classified into GH5, sequence analysis had suggested that these enzymes were more closely related to GH30 members. In consideration of these observations, the revised classification of St. John et al. employed phylogenetics, primary amino acid sequence and tertiary structure analysis to show that the glucuronoxylan xylanohydrolases in question, as well as several other enzyme groups previously classified as GH5 members, were indeed better placed in GH30.;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;2v3d;glucocerebrosidase 1;Homo sapiens;N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin;Glu235;Glu340;[27]
GH31;"?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20); ?-1,3-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.84); sucrase-isomaltase (EC 3.2.1.48) (EC 3.2.1.10); ?-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.177); ?-glucan lyase (EC 4.2.2.13); isomaltosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-).";CAZy Family GH31 is one of the two major families of glycoside hydrolases, along with GH13, that contain ?-glucosidases. These enzymes play important roles in primary metabolism (e.g. human sucrase/isomaltase, a target for diabetic drugs such as miglitol), in catabolism (e.g. human lysosomal ?-glucosidase) and in glycoprotein processing (e.g. ER glucosidase II). In addition to ?-glucosidases, GH31 also contains ?-xylosidases, isomaltosyltransferases, maltase/glucoamylases and the mechanistically interesting, non-hydrolytic ?-glucan lyases. These enzymes can be found in a wide range of organisms including archaea, bacteria, plants and animals. Interestingly the two mammalian digestive enzymes are both duplicated genes, each with dual specificities.;Family GH 31 enzymes are retaining ?-glycosidases, as was first demonstrated by a combination of polarimetric and reducing sugar measurement. GH31 enzymes (except for the ?-glucan lyases) are believed to follow the classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. This has been strongly supported by labeling of the catalytic nucleophile of several GH31 enzymes using conduritol B epoxide, with early examples including rabbit intestinal sucrase/isomaltase and human lysosomal ?-glucosidase. Later studies on an ?-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger and an ?-xylosidase from Escherichia coli used the more reliable 5-fluoroglycosyl fluoride trapping reagents, which form catalytically competent intermediates. The ?-glucan lyases from GH31 cleave ?-glucan polymers via an elimination mechanism to generate 1,5-anhydro-fructose (see Lexicon). Detailed mechanistic studies have been carried out on Gracilariopsis ?-1,4-glucan lyase revealing a mechanism that involves a nucleophilic displacement as the first step, followed by syn-elimination as the second step. Evidence for the first step includes trapping of the catalytically competent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate by 5-fluoro-?-L-idopyranosyl fluoride and the observation of secondary kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on both H-1 and H-2 of two ?-glucoside substrates. Direct proof of the second elimination step was provided by the observation of a small primary KIE on C-2 by using a substrate for which the elimination step is rate-limiting, 5-fluoro-?-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride.;Measurements of pH profiles suggested that two essential residues were involved in catalysis. Earlier active site-labeling studies employing conduritol B epoxide identified an invariant Asp residue as the catalytic nucleophile, corresponding to Asp224 of Aspergillus niger ?-glucosidase within the sequence IDM. This was confirmed by using the more reliable 5-fluoro-?-D-glucopyransyl fluoride reagent followed by subsequent peptide mapping by LC/MS-MS. The general acid/base residue was first tentatively assigned as Asp647 in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe ?-glucosidase based on sequence comparison and kinetic analysis of the mutants. This was subsequently confirmed by the crystallographic studies on ?-xylosidase (YicI) from Escherichia coli and successfully engineering YicI into the first ?-thioglycoligase by mutating the corresponding general acid/base residue D482. The catalytic nucleophile in Gracilariopsis ?-1,4-glucan lyase has been identified as Asp553 in the sequence QDM, through the use of 5-fluoro-?-L-idopyranosyl fluoride. This corresponds precisely to the position of the catalytic nucleophile in the GH31 glycosidases. However, the identity of the base which deprotonates H-2 in the second elimination step is not clear, though one of the most probable candidates was proposed to be the carboxyl group of the catalytic nucleophile as it departs.;The first crystal structure of a GH31 enzyme was that of the ?-xylosidase YicI from Escherichia coli , published in 2005. To date two other crystal structures of GH31 enzymes have been published, one being the Sulfolobus solfataricus ?-glucosidase (MalA) and the other being the N-terminal domain of human intestinal maltase-glucoamylase. All of these structures feature a (?/?)8 barrel in the catalytic domain. The Sulfolobus solfataricus ?-glucosidase (MalA) study is especially notable as the first experimental report to highlight the 3-D structural relationship of GH31 enzymes to those of GH27 and GH36.

Besides the 'historical' invertases, this family also contains enzymes that hydrolyze fructose containing polysaccharides such as inulinases (EC 3.2.1.7) and exo-inulinases (EC 3.2.1.80), levanases (EC 3.2.1.65) and ?-2,6-fructan 6-levanbiohydrolases(EC 3.2.1.64), fructan ?-(2,1)-fructosidase/1-exohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.153) or fructan ?-(2,6)-fructosidase/6-exohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.154), as well as enzymes displaying transglycosylating activities such as sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.99), fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.100), sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.10), fructan:fructan 6G-fructosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.243) and levan fructosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.-).;Family GH32 enzymes are retaining enzymes, as first shown by Koshland and Stein by performing the reaction in 18O-labeled water and determining the 18O content of the products. The transfructosylation activity (a type of transglycosylation activity) observed for invertase in this reaction indicated that the enzyme operates with a molecular mechanism leading to overall retention of the anomeric configuration.;The two residues, responsible for the catalytic reaction in family GH32 enzymes, have first been identified in yeast invertase as an aspartate located close to the N-terminus acting as the catalytic nucleophile and a glutamate acting as the general acid/base. An interesting feature concerns some members of GH32, such as the endo-inulinase from Aspergillus ficuum, that use a glutamate replacing the aspartate as catalytic nucleophile.;Several three dimensional structures of family GH32 enzymes have been solved so far. The first crystal structure was reported for the bacterial ?-fructosidase from Thermotoga maritima. Further crystal structures of enzymes and their substrate-complexes have been solved for two plant enzymes (cell wall invertase and fructan 1-exohydrolase ), as well as one fungal exo-inulinase. The core of the structure consists of a five-bladed ?-propeller appended to a ?-sandwich, consisting of two sheets of six ?-strands. Although sequence similarity is low within the sandwich modules, all family GH32 members contain such a module. A structural relationship of the catalytic core module exists to family GH68 (also member of Clan GH-J) and family GH43, as predicted by detailed sequence analysis.

GH35;"?-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23); exo-?-glucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.165)";The majority of glycoside hydrolases of GH35 are ?-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23). GH35 enzymes have been isolated from microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria and yeasts, as well as higher organisms such as plants, animals, and human cells. These ?-galactosidases catalyse the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing ?-D-galactose residues in, for example, lactose (1,4-O-?-D-galactopyranosyl-D-glucose), oligosaccharides, glycolipids, and glycoproteins. Various GH35 ?-galactosidases demonstrate specificity towards ?-1,3-, ?-1,6- or ?-1,4-galactosidic linkages, and are often most active under acidic conditions. As with many other CAZy families, GH35 members tend to be represented by multi-gene families in plants. Moreover, plant GH35 ?-galactosidases have be divided into two classes: members of the first are capable of hydrolyzing pectic ?-1,4-galactans, while those of the second can specifically cleave ?-1,3- and ?-1,6-galactosyl linkages of arabinogalactan proteins. In addition to ?-galactosidases, GH35 also contains a limited number of archeal exo-?-glucosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.165). Such enzymes hydrolyze chitosan or chitosan oligosaccharides to remove successive D-glucosamine residues from non-reducing termini.;Beta-galactosidases of GH35 catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal ?-galactosyl residues via a classical Koshland retaining mechanism, which leads to net retention of the ?-anomeric configuration of the released galactose molecule. The stereochemistry of the reaction was first shown by NMR for the human ?-galactosidase precursor and has been subsequently confirmed by other investigators for microbial and plant enzymes .;The catalytic residues for family 35 were first predicted on the basis of hydrophobic cluster analysis of proteins of similar protein fold. Experimentally, the glutamic acid residue 268 was first identified as the catalytic nucleophile in human lysosomal ?-galactosidase precursor using a slow substrate, 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-?-D-galactopyranoside, which allowed trapping of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping. This approach was repeated for two bacterial ?-galactosidases from Xanthomonas manihotis and Bacillus circulans. The general acid/base residue was inferred to be Glu200 from structural studies of a Penicillium sp. ?-galactosidase. Recent structural studies (vide infra) revealed two different conformations of the general acid/base residue in the ?-galactosidase of Trichoderma reesei.;The first 3D-structures of a GH35 enzyme, those of a ?-galactosidase from Pencillium sp. (Psp-?-gal) in native (PDB 1tg7) and product-complexed (PDB 1xc6) forms, were reported in 2004 at 1.90 ? and 2.10 ? resolution, respectively. The structure of a ?-galactosidase from Bacteriodes thetaiotamicron (Btm-?-gal) was subsequently reported by the New York Structural GenomiX Research Consortium in 2008 at 2.15 ? resolution (PDB 3d3a). In 2010, an atomic (1.2 ?) resolution crystal structure of a Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) ?-galactosidase (Tr-?-gal, PDB3og2) was reported, together with complex structures with galactose, IPTG and PETG at 1.5, 1.75 and 1.4 ? resolutions, respectively (PDB codes3ogr, 3ogs, and 3ogv, respectively). GH35 enzymes belong to Clan GH-A, and thus have an (?/?)8 (TIM) barrel as the catalytic domain, in which two glutamic acid residues act as the general acid-base and nucleophilic catalysts. These residues are located in strands 4 and 7 of the barrel. The comparison of the native structures of Psp-?-gal, Tr-?-gal and Btm?-gal reveals two things (Figure 1): Firstly, Btm-?-gal consists of three distinct domains, whereas Psp-?-gal and Tr-?-gal consist of five and six domains, respectively. The second and third domains of Btm-?-gal are quite similar with the fourth and fifth domains of Psp-?-gal, and with the fifth and sixth domains of Tr-?-gal. Secondly, major structural differences between Psp-?-gal and Tr-?-gal are in the conformations of the loop regions. Although the crystal structures of Psp-?-gal and Tr-?-gal are similar, the interpretation of the structure of Tr-?-gal is somewhat different from that presented earlier for Psp-?-gal: Rojas et al. considered Psp-?-gal to be composed of five distinct structural domains. The overall structure is built around the first, TIM barrel, domain. Domain 2 is an all ?-sheet domain containing an immunoglobulin-like subdomain, Domain 3 is based on a Greek-key ?-sandwich, and Domains 4 and 5 are jelly rolls. In contrast, Maksimainen et al. concluded the domain 2 includes two different domains and thus the Tr-?-gal and Psp-?-gal structures both form six similar domains. The superimposition of the active sites of the GH35 ?-galactosidases shows a remarkable similarity. In addition to the catalytic residues, the active sites of the GH35 ?-galactosidases contain many identical residues (Figure 1B). Based on the galactose-bound crystallographic models of Psp-?-gal and Tr-?-gal, a single galactose molecule is bound to the active site of the GH35 enzyme in the chair conformation in the ?-anomeric configuration. Additionally, Maksimainen et al. have described conformational changes in two loop regions of the active site of Tr-?-gal, that implicates a conformational selection mechanism for the enzyme (Figure 2). Unlike the induced fit theory, which assumes that the initial interaction between a protein and its binding partner induces a conformational change in the protein through a stepwise process, the conformational selection theory is based on the assumption that the unbound protein exists as an ensemble of conformations in dynamic equilibrium. Interaction between a weakly populated, higher-energy conformation and a binding partner causes the equilibrium to move in favor of the selected conformation. This can be seen in the structures of Tr-?-gal: the open and closed conformation are both favorable in the native structure and the closed conformation becomes more favorable in the complex structures. Furthermore, The acid/base catalyst Glu200 has two different conformations in the IPTG and PETG complex structures that clearly affects the pKa value of this residue and thus the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.;;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;1xc6;?-galactosidase;Penicillium sp.;d-galactose;Glu200;Glu299;[32]
GH36;"?-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22); ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49); stachyose synthase (EC 2.4.1.67); raffinose synthase (EC 2.4.1.82)";Glycoside hydrolases of family 36 exhibit ?-galactosidase and ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity, which has been demonstrated in archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic members of this family. Additionally, certain plant members of this family possess stachyose synthase or raffinose synthase activity.;Family GH36 ?-galactosidases are anomeric configuration-retaining enzymes, as first shown by NMR studies on the ?-galactosidase GalA from Thermotoga maritima. Correspondingly, GH36 enzymes use a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism, like their GH27 relatives in Clan GH-D. This mechanism involves the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate that partitions predominantly to water in hydrolytic enzymes and to saccharide acceptor substrates in transglycosylating enzymes, such as stachyose and raffinose synthases.;Detailed phylogenetic analysis of archaeal GH36 ?-galactosidases within Clan GH-D originally highlighted likely candidates for the catalytic nucleophileand general acid/base residues in this family, based on protein sequence similarity with those identified in GH27. Mutagenesis of the corresponding residues in Sulfolobus solfataricus ?-galactosidase GalS dramatically reduced enzyme activity: the D367G (catalytic nucleophile) and D425G (general acid/base) mutant had <1 x 10–3 and 5 x 10–3 lower activity than the wild type enzyme when assayed against p-nitrophenyl ?-D-galactopyranoside. Rescue of the catalytic function of both enzyme mutants was unsuccessful with both azide and formate anions. The identities of the catalytic residues in GH36 were also confirmed in the Thermotoga maritima ?-galactosidase GalA, guided by structural homology with GH27 enzymes. Site-directed mutation of Asp327 to Gly yielded a variant that had a 200-800-fold lower rate on aryl galactosides compared with the WT enzyme. Addition of azide was shown to rescue the ability of the enzyme to cleave p-nitrophenyl ?-D-galactopyranoside and resulted in formation of ?-galactopyranosyl azide, confirming Asp327 as the catalytic nucleophile. Mutation of the predicted general acid/base residue, Asp387, to Gly reduced activity 1500-fold on p-nitrophenyl ?-D-galactopyranoside, while addition of azide resulted in formation of ?-galactopyranosyl azide by nucleophilic attack on the ?-linked glycosyl enzyme intermediate.;"In June 2005, the first three-dimensional structural coordinates for a member of this family, ?-galactosidase TmGalA from Thermotoga maritima, were deposited by the Joint Center For Structural Genomics (JCSG) (X-ray, 2.34 ?, PDB 1zy9). Subsequent analysis of this data in the context of existing structures of GH27 enzymes, revealed homologous active site residues, including two key catalytic Asp residues and a number of conserved substrate-binding residues. The active sites of both GH27 and GH36 enzymes are presented by (?/?)8 (TIM) barrel domains. Both GH36 and GH27 enzymes contain a C-terminal ?-sheet domain of unknown function, although this domain is structurally different and more disordered in TmGalA compared with the homologous domain in GH27 (e.g., Oryza sativa ?-galactosidase, PDB 1uas). Notably, an extra N-terminal, primarily ?-sheet domain, which is not found in GH27 enzymes, contributes a key substrate-binding residue (Trp65) to the active site of TmGalA (Trp65, replacing Trp164 in the O. sativa enzyme). Another notable active site substitution, this time within the TIM barrel itself, is the replacement of the aromatic residues Phe328 and Trp 291 in TmGalA with Ser102 and the Cys101-Cys132 disulfide in the O. sativa enzyme. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of Clan GH-D, comprised of GH36 and GH27, has indicated that archaeal GH36 enzymes are more closely related to plant ""alkaline"" ?-galactosidases, raffinose synthases, and stachyose synthases than to bacterial and fungal members. Thermophilic bacterial sequences, such as TmGalA, appear to form a divergent cluster within this latter subgroup.";Mechanistic commonality with family GH27 demonstrated by Comfort et al.

GH37;?,?-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28).;GH37 glycoside hydrolases have been shown, to date, to hydrolyse only the disaccharide trehalose (?-D-glucopyranosyl-(1?1)-?-D-glucopyranoside) into two molecules of D-glucose (EC 3.2.1.28).;A trehalase from flesh fly was shown to hydrolyse with inversion of anomeric stereochemistry using 18O-labelled water. The structural solution of the trehalase from Escherichia coli also demonstrates the active site catalytic residues are in a position consistent with an inverting mechanism.;The catalytic residues have not been demonstrated unequivocally, but structural determination of the trehalase from Escherichia coli in complex with inhibitors in the active site implicate an aspartate residue (Asp312 in E. coli) as the catalytic general acid and a glutamate residue (Glu496 in E. coli) as the catalytic general base.;The only structural representative from GH37 to date is the trehalase from Escherichia coli, which was solved using X-ray crystallography. The structure revealed a (?/?)6 barrel fold, similar to other ?-toroidal glycosidases such as those in families GH94, GH15 and GH65. GH37 falls into clan GH-G.

GH38;"?-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) ; mannosyl-oligosaccharide ?-1,3-1,6-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.114); mannosyl-oligosaccharide ?-1,3-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.-)";Glycoside hydrolases of family 38 are Class II ?-mannosidases. They range in breadth of specificity from the Golgi ?-mannosidase (2A1), which has a dual specificity for ?-1,6 and ?-1,3-linked mannoses, to the lysosomal mannosidases, which have either broad (2B1 cleaves ?1,2, ?1,3 and ?1,6 linkages) or narrow specificities (2B2 is specific for ?-1,6). GH38 active sites can be quite long and open, and some are sensitive to the polysaccharide substrate structure. For example, Golgi ?-mannosidase II requires the presence of a GlcNAc residue some five residues away from the cleavage site, while lysosomal mannosidases do not have that requirement. There have been GH38 mannosidases identified in a number of different localizations, classed into subfamilies with different substrate specificities and biochemical properties, and, presumably, different physiological roles. The Golgi enzyme is identified as 2A1 (Class 2, A for Golgi, enzyme 1). Lysosomal GH38 mannosidases are indicated by 'B' (2B1, 2B2) and those likely existing in the cytoplasm by 'C'. Physiological roles have been identified for the Golgi enzyme in the protein N-glycosylation pathway and lysosomal mannosidases in general are likely to be involved in scavenging of degraded glycoproteins. Roles for the cytoplasmic subclass have not been identified definitively, but they may play a role in protein recognition or signalling.;GH38 enzymes are anomeric-configuration retaining enzymes that operate by the classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. This was initially determined by trapping of the covalent intermediate with jack bean ?-mannosidase and later confirmed by structural analysis of covalent intermediates;Both catalytic side chains are Asp residues. The catalytic nucleophile of Asp204 (Golgi ?-mannosidase II crystal structure numbering) was inferred from previous studies with jack Bean ?-mannosidase and confirmed in the crystal structures of covalent intermediates. Mutagenesis studies implicated Asp341 as the likely catalytic acid/base residue.;"The crystal structure of the GH38 domain of Drosophila Golgi ?-mannosidase II has been determined in complex with a large number of inhibitors and intermediate mimics. Many of these are at very high resolution: 1.2-1.6? (see for examples). An enzyme-substrate complex has also been determined. The crystal structure of bovine lysosomal ?-mannosidase II was determined to 2.7? resolution and displayedinteresting low-pH activation effects. Some of the lysosomal enzymes show a metal dependency for activity. Mutations in the residues proposed to be involved with metal binding are associated with lysosomal storage diseases. The GH38 fold has been referred to as the ""mannosidase fold"". It is one large (approximately 1000-residue) globular domain, which can be roughly divided by secondary structure into an ?/? portion and an all-? region. The former portion contains the active site, anchored by a Zn atom, which forms an integral part of the -1 site, interacting with the saccharide and helping to induce substrate distortion.";;none;(?/?)7;alpha;retaining;anti;1qwn;?-mannosidase II;Drosophila melanogaster;5-F-?-l-gulosyl;Asp341;Asp204;[34]
GH39;"?-L-iduronidase (EC 3.2.1.76); ?-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37).";This glycoside hydrolase family contains two known enzyme activities: ?-xylosidase and ?-L-iduronidase. Both enzyme activities cleave equatorial glycosidic bonds: the '?' designation of ?-iduronidase is a consequence of the stereochemical designations used for carbohydrates in which the ?/? designation is related to the D/L designation defined by the stereochemistry at C5 in hexopyranoses. Enzyme from this family are currently found in bacteria and eukaryotes, although one gene sequence encoding a putative Family GH39 enzyme from archaea has been reported. The known ?-xylosidase enzymes for which an enzyme activity has been experimentally established all come from bacteria, while the ?-iduronidase enzymes all come from eukaryotes. Additionally, while there is a reasonable degree of sequence similarity within the ?-xylosidases in GH39 and within the ?-iduronidases in GH39, there is a much lower degree of homology between the ?-xylosidases and ?-iduronidases. The best-studied enzymes are human ?-iduronidase, whose deficiency causes Mucopolysaccharidosis I (also known as Hurler-Scheie syndrome), and the ?-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum.;Family GH39 enzymes are retaining glycoside hydrolases that follow the classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. This has been demonstrated experimentally through NMR analysis of the first-formed sugar product produced by glycoside hydrolysis by the ?-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum and human ?-iduronidase, and by covalent trapping of the catalytic nucleophile (described below) for these two enzymes. These enzymes do not appear to require any activator or cofactor for activity.;The catalytic nucleophile was first identified in the ?-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum as Glu-277 in the sequence IILNSHFPNLPFHITEY by trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-xylosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping by LC/MS-MS. A similar analysis performed on human ?-iduronidase also successfully trapped the catalytic nucleophile and identified it as Glu-299 in the sequence IYNDEAD, which confirmed previous theoretical predictions. The general acid/base residue has been experimentally identified in the ?-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum as Glu-160 through trapping using the affinity label N-bromoacetyl-?-D-xylopyranosylamine and analysis of variant proteins created by mutation of that site.;The three-dimensional structure of the ?-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum was first solved in 2004. Since then, the three dimensional structure for another GH39 ?-xylosidase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus has also been solved. No experimentally determined three dimensional structure exists for the ?-iduronidase enzymes, although a computer-generated homology model has been reported. GH39 enzymes are members of the clan GH-A fold, consistent with the classic (?/?)8 TIM barrel fold with the two key active site glutamic acids located at the C-terminal ends of ?-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile).;;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;1uhv;?-xylosidase;Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum;2-F-xylosyl;Glu160;Glu277;[35]

GH42;?-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23);The most common activity for glycoside hydrolases of this family are ?-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23), however, other commonly found activities are ?-L-arabinosidase (EC 3.2.1.55) and ?-D-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.38) with both KM and kcat values being of the same order of magnitude for the different substrates. Apparently, these enzymes show strict specificity for axial C4-OH groups. Family GH42 enzymes have been identified only in unicellular organisms, mainly from prokaryotes (in majority bacteria), and with a few examples from archaea and fungi. GH42 enzymes are active on lactose and transgalactosylation was observed with production of galactooligosaccharides. However, several GH42 enzymes are extracted from diverse habitats where lactose would not be present and they are very active on galactooligosaccharides and galactans, suggesting that these enzymes would be involved in vivo in plant cell wall degradation. This function could be performed in cooperation with family GH53 galactanases, often encoded from genes adjacent to GH42 genes, and with cellulosome. The activity of GH42 enzymes on lactose and also lactulose has interesting potential for the removal of the former from dairy products and to monitor lactulose concentration during heat treatment leading to UHT milk.;Family GH42 ?-galactosidase are retaining enzymes, as first shown by NMR, and follow the classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. Enzymes whose reaction mechanism has been well studied include the ?-galactosidase from Thermus thermophilus A4, YesZ from Bacillus subtilis, and the enzyme from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius.;The catalytic nucleophile was first identified in the B. subtilis YesZ ?-galactosidase as Glu295 through the use of a mechanism-based inhibitor that allowed trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluorogalactosyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent peptide mapping. These experiments were performed on the mutant of the inferred acid/base, which was more sensitive to the inhibitor. The general acid/base catalyst was first identified as Glu157 in the ?-galactosidase from A. acidocaldarius through detailed mechanistic analysis and azide rescue experiments of a mutant in that position.;Only one three-dimensional structure is available for enzymes belonging to Family GH42, that of the ?-galactosidase from T. thermophilus A4, which was solved at 1.6 ? and 2.2 ? resolution in the free and galactose-bound enzyme, respectively. As members of Clan GH-A, Family GH42 enzymes show the catalytic dyad at the C-terminal ends of ?-strands 4 (acid/base) and 7 (nucleophile) within a domain showing a classical (?/?)8 TIM barrel (domain A). This catalytic domain contains a metal-binding site with a Zn atom that is not related with the binding of galactose and that thereby seems to have structural features. Domain B, showing a ?/? fold domain, is involved in the native trimer formation while the function of domain C (? fold domain) is unknown;Identification of the catalytic residues in doi:10.1016/j.febslet.2007.04.053;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;1kwk;?-galactosidase;Thermus thermophylus A4;d-galactose;Glu141;Glu312;[36]

An enzyme with exo ?-1,3-galactanase has also been described. A significant number of enzymes in this family display both ?-L-arabinofuranosidase and ?-D-xylosidase activity using aryl-glycosides as substrates. It is likely that the natural activity of these enzymes is conferred by the aglycone component of the substrate. Indeed, the arabionofuranosidase activities already reported target very different glycans. Thus, the Bacillus subtilis enzyme arabinoxylan ?-L-arabinofuranohydrolase specifically removes arabinofuranose side chains that are linked either ?-1,2 or ?-1,3 to backbone xylose residues, while the arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase-D3 (AXHd3) from Bifidobacterium adolescentis will remove an ?-1,3-linked arabinofuranose from xylans where the xylose residue is substituted at both ?-1,2 and ?-1,3 with arabinose. By contrast some arabinofuranosidases are exo-?-1,5-L-arabinanases. It should be noted that in several plant cell wall degrading organisms there has been a dramatic expansion in GH43 family enzymes, which may reflect a more extensive range of specificities than described to date.;NMR, deploying arabinan as the substrate, showed that an endo-?-1,5-arabinanase uses an inverting mechanism. However, the first demonstration of an inverting enzyme, which was later shown to be a GH43 ?-xylosidase, was by using a linked assay with a anomeric stereospecific D-xylose isomerase.;The catalytic general base, an aspartate, the catalytic general acid, a glutamate, and an aspartate that modules the pKa of the general acid were identified through the crystal structure of Cellvibrio japonicus CjAbn43A, and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Further biochemical proof for the catalytic function of the equivalent residues in a ?-xylosidase were obtained by demonstrating a relationship between the activity of the catalytic acid and the pKa of the leaving group of the substrate. The identity of the catalytic base was achieved by azide rescue of a mutant of this residue. In contrast to many inverting glycoside hydrolases there appears to be a single candidate catalytic general base.;The GH43 enzymes display a 'non-velcroed' five-bladed-?-propeller. The propeller is based upon a five-fold repeat of blades composed of four-stranded ?-sheets. The substrate-binding surface of Arb43A is in a long surface depression, with the catalytic constellation of carboxylates at its center. The exo-processive activity of the enzyme is conferred by a subtle steric block at the +3 subsite explaining why the enzyme releases, exclusively, arabinotriose. In the arabinofuranosidases and xylosidases the active site comprises a deep pocket and the orientation of the substrate is very different between the enzymes, which contributes to the varied specificities observed across the GH43 landscape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GH44;"ndoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4); xyloglucanase (EC 3.2.1.151)";GH44 glycoside hydrolases are active on many substances, including tetrasaccharide cellooligosaccharides and longer oligomers, carboxymethylcellulose, xylan, lichenan, Avicel (slightly), and xyloglucan, the last of which appears to be a prime substrate.;"The most complete analyses of GH44 kinetics on various substrates are by Najmudin et al. and by Warner et al.. GH44 endoglucanases are also xyloglucanases. They hydrolyze longer cellooligosaccharides faster than shorter cellooligosaccharides. They act asymmetrically on cellooligosaccharides, for instance producing more cellobiose and cellotetraose than cellotriose from cellohexaose, with substrates bound with more of their residues in negatively-numbered than in positively-numbered subsites. Furthermore, disproportionation occurs, with more cellotetraose than cellobiose formed from cellohexaose, evidently caused by formation of larger unobserved products that are then rapidly hydrolyzed. GH44 enzymes act with retention of anomeric stereochemistry, through a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism with a covalent bond being formed between the catalytic nucleophile and the anomeric carbon of the substrate, leading to liberation of the leaving group; subsequently, the glycosyl-enzyme is cleaved by water. A general acid/base residue acts as a general acid in the first step to assist departure of the aglycon; in the second step this residue acts as a general base to assist in deprotonating a nucleophilic water residue.";"The catalytic residues in this family have been suggested by several experiments with diverse enzymes. These include: Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase: General acid/base, Glu186; catalytic nucleophile, Glu359; by soaking the wild-type crystals with cellopentaose or cellohexaose and noting the positions of the residues relative to the reducing end of the cellotetraose product, and also by finding no activity with E186Q and E359Q mutants. Protein from metagenomic library: General acid/base, Glu221; catalytic nucleophile, Glu393 by location in the active site of the wild-type crystal structure.

GH45;endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4);"Glycoside hydrolases of GH45 are endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4); mainly the hydrolysis of soluble ?-1,4 glucans. GH45 enzymes are perhaps best known for their uses in the textile / detergent industries (see for example).";"The enzymes, formally known as cellulase family ""K"" in some historic literature, act with inversion of anomeric configuration to generate the ?-D anomer of the oligosaccharide as product.";"Based upon the structure of the Humicola insolens endoglucanase V (now known as Cel45) it was concluded that Asp121 (in an HxD motif) acted as the general acid (implied by its hydrogen bonding to the glycosidic oxygen of a ligand in the +1 subsite) and that the most likely general base is Asp10 (in a YxD motif), appropriately positioned ""below"" the sugar plane. As with many inverting enzymes the general base assignment is less secure than that of the acid.";"The 3-D structure of canonical GH45 enzymes is a six-stranded ?-barrel to which a seventh strand is appended. The structure differs from classical ?-barrels in containing both parallel and anti-parallel ?-strands. At the time of the first structure solution the fold had ony previously been observed in ""Barwin""; a plant defense protein of unknown function. As is now expected for endo-enzymes, the active centre is located in an open substrate-binding groove. The original native (uncomplexed) structure had an disordered loop above the active centre and this was only seen to become ordered subsequently upon the binding of cello-oligosaccharides. Family GH45 enzymes are structurally related to plant and bacterial expansins. Indeed they even display some of the catalytic centre motifs such as the catalytic acid. The putative catalytic base is absent in plant and bacterial expansins. There are also a few fungal GH45 members, exemplified by Phanerochaete chrysosporium Cel45 which also appear to lack the putative base.";"formerly known as cellulase family K; distantly related to plant expansins";none;6-strand. ?-barrel;beta;inverting;syn;4eng;endo-1,4-glucanase;Humicola insolens;cellohexaose;Asp121;Asp10;[38]
GH46;chitosanase (EC 3.2.1.132);Glycoside hydrolases of family 46 are essentially all endo-?-1,4-chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) that hydrolyze various links in chitosan, a polymer of ?-1,4-linked D-glucosamine (GlcN) units with a variable content (mostly 0 - 35%) of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Among the four types of links occurring between these two kinds of subunits in chitosan, all the enzymes examined for their cleavage specificity acted upon the GlcN-GlcN links. In addition, the chitosanase from Bacillus circulans MH-K1 recognized also GlcN-GlcNAc links, while the chitosanase from Streptomyces sp. N174 recognized the GlcNAc-GlcN links.;Family GH46 enzymes utilize an inverting mechanism, as shown by NMR.;The catalytic residues have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis and crystallography in the chitosanase from Streptomyces sp. N174. The general acid residue is Glu22 in the sequence SSAENSS, while Asp40 (DIGDGRG) is the general base residue. The latter could activate the nucleophilic water molecule with assistance from residue Thr45 (RGYTGGI). Analysis of sequence alignments as well as crystallographic evidence showed that the same function is played by residues Glu37 (in the sequence NKPEQDD) , Asp55 (DIEDERG) and Thr60 (RGYTIGL) in the chitosanase from Bacillus circulans MH-K1.;"Two structures have been solved using X-ray crystallography, for the chitosanases from Streptomyces sp. N174 and from Bacillus circulans MH-K1 (wild-type enzyme and mutant K218P. These enzymes have essentially an ?-helical fold, with two globular domains separated by the active site cleft for substrate binding. The cleft is bordered on the upper face by a three-stranded ?-sheet. The structure of GH46 enzymes is similar to the 3D fold of the well studied lysozyme of bacteriophage T4 of Escherichia coli belonging to family GH24 and, to some extent, to the structures of lysozymes from families GH22, GH23 as well the chitinases from family GH19. These five families are sometimes grouped in the ""lysozyme superfamily"". The crystal structures, completed by site-directed mutagenesis have also revealed several residues involved in substrate binding. For the chitosanase from Streptomyces sp N174, the mode of binding of a GlcN hexasaccharide was established as being in conformity with a symmetrical 3+3 model, based on the analysis of products of hydrolysis.";;I;? + ?;beta;inverting;predicted syn by clan;see at GH24;;;;;;

GH48;"reducing end-acting cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.176); endo-?-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4); chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14)";Family 48 glycoside hydrolases are major and key components of some cellulase systems, occurring in free enzyme systems (e.g., in Thermobifida fusca), multi-functional enzymes (e.g, in Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus), anaerobic fungi (e.g.,Piromyces equi) and every cellulosome system thus far described. The GH48 cellulase is commonly the most abundant enzyme subunit in cellulosome-producing bacteria. Each bacterium usually contains a single gene that codes for a GH48 enzyme, although a few bacteria (e.g., Clostridium thermocellum and Anaerocellum thermophilum) contain two or more GH48 genes. Of the two C. thermocellum GH48 enzymes, one (Cel48S) is a dockerin-containing cellulosomal enzyme, and the other (Cel48Y) is a free, non-cellulosomal enzyme that contains a cellulose-binding CBM3. The following activities have been reported: endo-?-1,4-glucanase, chitinase, endo-processive cellulase and cellobiohydrolase. Its preferred substrate is amorphous or crystalline cellulose over carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and its activity is strongly inhibited by the presence of cellobiose. Although its activity on various substrates is characteristically very low, it is thought to be a critically important enzyme which imparts a major component of synergy to its cellulase system.;The glycoside hydrolases of this family are inverting glycosidases, which preferentially attack the reducing end of the substrate. The native and recombinant Cel48S from C. thermocellum displays typical characteristics of a processive exoglucanase, and its activity on amorphous cellulose is optimal at 70 °C and at pH 5–6. Family 48 cellulases (i.e., CelS/S8 from C. thermocellum, Avicelase II of C. stercorarium) are stabilized at high temperatures by Ca2+ or other bivalent ions. The Cel48F protein from C. cellulolyticum has been reported to be a processive endo-glucanase, which performs a processive degradation of the cellulose chain after an initial endo-attack. A two-step mechanism was proposed, in which processive action and chain disruption occupy different subsites.;The crystal structure of Cel48F, a cellulosome component of C. cellulolyticum, revealed the active center at the junction of the cleft and tunnel regions, where Glu55 is the proposed proton donor in the cleavage reaction, and the corresponding base was initially proposed to be either Glu44 or Asp230. The structure of the catalytic module of Cel48S of C. thermocellum showed a similar tunnel-shaped substrate-binding region formed by the alpha helices in the protein. The hydrolysis of the cellulose chain in Cel48S appeared to involve Glu87 (the equivalent of Glu55 in C. cellulolyticum Cel48F) as an acid to protonate the glycosidic oxygen atom and Tyr351 as a base to extract a proton from the nucleophilic water molecule that attacks the anomeric carbon atom. More recent studies of Cel48F failed to unambiguously identity the catalytic base in the cleavage reaction.;Three-dimensional structures are available for two family 48 enzymes: Cel48F (from Clostridium cellulolyticum) and Cel48A (from Clostridium thermocellum). Both enzymes have an (?/?)6 barrel topology.;formerly known as cellulase family L. Some cellobiohydrolases of this family have been reported to act from the reducing ends of cellulose (EC 3.2.1.-), while others have been reported to operate from the non-reducing ends to liberate cellobiose or cellotriose or cellotetraose (EC 3.2.1.-).

The major activities reported for this family of glycoside hydrolases are dextranase (EC 3.2.1.11), and a dextranase from Penicillium minioluteum, Dex49A, is currently the most characterised enzyme. Dextran 1,6-?-isomaltotriosidase (EC 3.2.1.95) and isopullulanase (EC 3.2.1.57) activities have also been described.;Family GH49 ?-glycosidases are inverting enzymes, as first shown by NMR on a dextranase Dex49A from Penicillium minioluteum .;Three Asp residues (Asp376, Asp395, and Asp396 in Dex49A) are conserved in the catalytic centre of members of clan GH-N, GH49 and GH28 enzymes, and all three of the Asp mutants of a GH49 enzyme, isopullulanase, lost their activities. The general acid was first identified in Dex49A from Penicillium minioluteum as Asp395 following the three-dimensional structure determination. To date, it is unclear whether either (or both) of the Asp residues (Asp376 and Asp396 in Dex49A) acts as a general base in the reaction of GH49 and GH28 enzymes.;Two structures of GH49 enzymes are available so far, and they display a two domain structure. The N-terminal domain is a ?-sandwich and the C-terminal domain adopts a right-handed parallel ?-helix. The similarity of the ?-helix fold between GH49 and GH28 enzymes has been described, although almost none of the amino acid residues other than the three catalytic Asp residues is conserved between the two families.

GH50;?-agarase (EC 3.2.1.81).;To date, all characterized glycoside hydrolases of family 50 are ?-agarases (EC 3.2.1.81) that cleave ?-1,4 glycosidic bonds of agarose, releasing neoagaro-biose -tetraose and -hexaose. Three enzymes, Aga50A and Aga50D from Saccharophagus degradans and Aga50B from Vibrio sp. have been reported to be pure exo-?-agarases.;That GH50 enzymes potentially utilize a retaining mechanism has only been inferred by analogy with clan GH-A enzymes. No mechanistic or kintetic analysis demonstrating the stereochemical outcome of the reaction have been reported for this family to date.;Similarly, the catalytic residues in this family have not been directly identified, but may be inferred from superposition with other clan GH-A enzymes.;"Unknown; from analogy to clan GH-A enzymes it can be inferred that the 3D structure will be based on a (?/?)8 barrel fold.";;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;predicted anti by clan;see e.g. at GH1;;;;;;
GH51;"?-L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55); endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.4)";The majority of the glycoside hydrolases from this family hydrolyze the glycosidic bond between L-arabinofuranosides side chains of hemicelluloses such as arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan, and L-arabinan. A few enzymes of the family exhibit ?-1,4-endoglucanase activity towards carboxymethyl cellulose and xylan.;GH51 L-arabinfuranosidases are retaining enzymes and follow a classical Koshland retaining mechanism. Owing to the fast mutarotation and tautomerization rates of arabinose, the stereochemical course of the reaction was monitored in presence of methanol and followed by NMR spectroscopy. Enzymes that have been well studied kinetically include the Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 and Thermobacillus xylanilyticus ?-L-arabinofuranosidases, for which a detailed kinetic study was performed including kinetics with aryl-?-L-arabinofuranosides bearing various leaving groups, Br?nsted plots for the E175A acid-base catalytic residue and azide-rescue for the E294A nucleophilc mutant.;The general acid/base was first identified in Thermobacillus xylanilyticus (Glu176) and in Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6 (Glu175) ?-arabinofuranosidases using kinetic analysis, pH dependence profiles, and azide rescue of the catalytic mutant. The catalytic nucleophile was first identified in Geobacillus stearothermophilus ?-arabinofuranosidase through detailed kinetic studies for the catalytic mutant including azide rescue.;Three-dimensional structures for GH51 arabinofuranosidases are available for Geobacillus stearothermophilus Clostridium thermocellum and Thermobacillus xylanilyticus.

A number of patents on industrial applications of GH53 have been filed.;GH53 ?-1,4-galactanases follow a retaining mechanism as first demonstrated by following the stereochemical course of rection for the endo-?-1,4-galactanase of the bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus (at that time referred to as Pseudomonas fluorescens subspecies cellulosa). Most characterized members have been reported to be endo-acting, although processivity has been suggested in one case.;"The catalytic residues were first identified for the endo-?-1,4-galactanase of the bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus (previously known as Pseudomonas fluorescens subspecies cellulosa). Prior to structure determination Henrissat used hydrophobic cluster analysis and sequence alignments to predict that the family belonged to clan GH-A, and the two proposed catalytic residues, which were confirmed by a combination of mutagenesis and kinetic analysis; one acting as a general acid/base (E161) and the other as a catalytic nucleophile (E270).";As for all members of Clan GH-A, structurally characterized GH53 enzymes display a (?/?)8 barrel structure for the catalytic domain, usually with fairly compact loop structure and a sequence under 400 residues in length. The catalytic residues are typically positioned at the C-terminal ends of ?strands 4 and 7 in the barrel. Somewhat unusually, none of the four structurally characterized GH53 catalytic domains was accompanied by other catalytic domains or accessory modules, but modularity can be inferred by sequence in other members of the family. A disulphide bridging two loops (?/? loops 7 and 8) in 3 known fungal structures, is replaced functionally by a calcium ion in one bacterial structure. For one bacterial member of the family ligand complexes with products have been obtained crystallographically, occupying subsites -4 to -2 and +1 to +2.

GH54;"?-L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55); ?-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37).";This family of glycoside hydrolases contains ?-L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55) and ?-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37). Most of the family members have eukaryotic (fungal) origin. Several homologous genes are found from Bacterial genomes, but none of their gene products are characterized.;Glycoside hydrolases of family 54 are retaining enzymes. In 1996, many ?-L-arabinofuranosidases from fungi, including GH54 arabinofuranosidase B from Aspergillus niger, were shown to use a retaining mechanism by 1H NMR analysis using p-nitrophenyl ?-L-arabinofuranoside and by measurement of glycosyl transfer reactions to methanol. In the 1980's, two ?-L-arabinofuranosidases (AF I and AF III) from Monilinia fructigena were shown to be retaining enzymes by various methods including suicide inactivation with 3H-labelled 1-?-L-arabinofuranosylmethyl-3-p-nitrophenyltriazene as well as measurement of glycosyl transfer reactions using p-nitrophenyl ?-L-arabinofuranoside and methanol, but the genes for these enzymes are not cloned yet. If either AF I or AF III belongs to GH54, one of these studies represents the first stereochemistry determination of this family.;The catalytic residues were firstly estimated by superimposing the active site structure of ?-L-arabinofuranosidase B (AkAbfB) from Aspergillus kawachii with a Glycoside Hydrolase Family 51 enzyme, ?-L-arabinofuranosidase A from Geobacillus stearothermophilus T-6. Based on the relative positions with an arabinose molecule, Glu221 and Asp297 were estimated as thecatalytic nucleophile and the general acid/base, respectively. E221A mutant of this enzyme showed no detectable activity, and E297A mutant showed 10-3-fold activity of wild type. Kinetic studies using mutant enzymes of ?-L-arabinofuranosidase from Trichoderma koningii G-39 confirmed this assignment.;The first solved 3-D structure was ?-L-arabinofuranosidase B (AkAbfB) from Aspergillus kawachii IFO 4308 (PDB ID 1wd4 in complex with arabinose) in 2004.

GH55;"exo-?-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.58); endo-?-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39).";"Glycoside Hydrolase family 55 consists exclusively of ?-1,3-glucanases, including both exo- and endo-enzymes. All biochemically characterized members of this family are of fungal origin, although there are no yeast homologues. Several homologous genes have been identified in bacterial genomes, but none of the corresponding gene products have been characterized. The enzymes belonging to this family are generally called ""laminarinases,"" because they hydrolyze laminarin from brown algae (?-1,3-glucan having single ?-1,6-glucoside side chains: ?-1,3/1,6-glucan). However, the physiological substrate for the enzymes might be fungal cell wall, whose major component is also ?-1,3/1,6-glucan. The majority of the members in this family are exo-glucan-1,3-?-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.58), which cleave the terminal ?-1,3-glycosidic linkage at the non-reducing end of ?-1,3-glucans or ?-1,3/1,6-glucans. Many produce gentiobiose (?-D-glucopyranosyl-1,6-D-glucose) in addition to glucose during the degradation of ?-1,3/1,6-glucan. Bgn13.1 from Hypocrea lixii (formerly known as Trichoderma harzianum) and LamAI from Trichoderma viride were characterised as endo-acting enzymes (EC 3.2.1.39).";Family 55 enzymes are inverting enzymes, as shown by 1NMR analysis on ExgS from Aspergillus phoenicis (formerly known as Aspergillus saitoi). Release of ?-glucose was subsequently confirmed by polarimetric analysis on family 55 enzymes from Acremonium persicinum. These results are consistent with many classical reports on gentiobiose-producing exo-?-1,3-glucanases from fungi, although the genes for these enzymes have not yet been described.;The crystal structure of exo-?-1,3-glucanase Lam55A from Phanerochaete chrysospoirum K-3 complexed with gluconolactone (PDB ID 3eqo) suggests that Glu633 is the general acid. A candidate nucleophilic water was found near the C-1 atom of gluconolactone, but no acidic residue corresponding to the general base was identified in the vicinity of the water molecule. In classical studies of a exo-?-1,3-glucanase from Sporotrichum dimorphosporum (formerly known as Basidiomycete QM-806), Jeffcoat and Kirkwood reported that chemical modification of histidine residues in the catalytic site of the enzyme caused irreversible loss of activity, suggesting a crucial role of a histidine residue.;The first solved 3-D structure was Lam55A from P. chrysosporium. In this structure, two tandem ?-helix domains are positioned side-by-side to form a rib cage-like structure. The active site is located between the two ?-helix domains.

The two were the heat-stable eubacterial amylase from Dictyoglomus thermophilum known from 1988 and the extremely thermostable archaeal amylase from Pyrococcus furiosus determined in 1993. The family has expanded mainly due to the results of genome sequencing projects. Hundreds of members are known, all from prokaryotes (with ~1:4 ratio for Archaea:Bacteria). The enzyme specificities of family GH57 includes ?-amylase (EC3.2.1.1), ?-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22), amylopullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41), branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18) and 4-?-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25). It is worth mentioning that the two founding members, i.e. the “?-amylases” fromDictyoglomus thermophilum and Pyrococcus furiosus are 4-?-glucanotransferases; the former was proven to have transglycosylating activity, whereas the latter was already known to exhibit also the 4-?-glucanotransferase activity.";A direct evidence for the stereochemical outcome of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction has been presented for the branching enzyme from Thermus thermophilus by the NMR analysis of reaction products. The previous observation of a trapped covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was also a strong evidence that the GH57 enzymes operate with retention of anomeric configuration through a classical Koshland retaining mechanism with retention of anomeric configuration. The X-ray structure of the 4-?-glucanotransferase from Thermococcus litoralis revealed average distances of 6.72 ? and 6.97 ? between the catalytic nucleophile (Glu123) and general acid/base (Asp214) in the free and acarbose-bound forms of the enzyme, respectively, which also supports a retaining mechanism for this family (see also). Detailed kinetic studies have been performed on several GH57 enzymes, including the 4-?-glucanotransferases fromThermococcus litoralis and Pyrococcus furiosus, amylopullulanases from Thermococcus hydrothermalis andPyrococcus furiosus, and branching enzymes from Thermococcus kodakaraensis and Thermus thermophilus.;The sequences of GH57 members are very diverse. Some sequences are shorter than 400 residues whereas others are longer than 1,500 residues. This complicated early efforts to align the GH57 sequences using standard alignment methods. A detailed bioinformatics study by Zona et al. focused on all available GH57 sequences at that time and identified five conserved sequence regions. This study used knowledge of the identity of the catalytic nucleophile (Glu123) in the GH57 4-?-glucanotransferase from Thermococcus litoralis together with the three-dimensional structure (PDB ID 1k1w) that revealed the general acid/base residue (Asp214). The catalytic nucleophile (a glutamate) and general acid/base (an aspartate) are located in the conserved sequence regions 3 and 4, respectively. In addition to assignments in Thermococcus litoralis 4-?-glucanotransferase discussed above, these residues were identified in the amylopullulanases from Thermococcus hydrothermalis and Pyrococcus furiosus. Thecatalytic nucleophile was also identified in the ?-galactosidase from Pyrococcus furiosus although no success was achieved in assigning the general acid/base. It should be taken into account that some GH57 members, which are only hypothetical enzymes/proteins without any biochemical characterization, may lack one or even both catalytic residues. Based on the five identified conserved sequence regions, the residues His13, Glu79, Glu216 and Asp354 together with Trp120, Trp221 and Trp357 (Thermococcus hydrothermalis amylopullulanase numbering) were postulated as important determinants of the individual GH57 enzyme specificities. Of these, the Trp221 has already been confirmed to contribute to the transglycosylation activity of 4-?-glucanotransferase since the mutant W229H of the enzyme from Pyrococcus furiosus exhibited markedly decreased transglycosylation activity in comparison with the wild-type counterpart.;The structure of the catalytic domain adopts a (?/?)7-barrel, i.e. the irregular (?/?)8-barrel called a pseudo TIM-barrel. In the case of the Thermococcus litoralis 4-?-glucanotransferase the catalytic domain is succeeded by a C-terminal non-catalytic domain consisting of only ?-strands that adopts a twisted ?-sandwich fold. In the three-dimensional structure of the ?-amylase AmyC from Thermotoga maritima (PDB ID 2b5d) (note that the sequence of this enzyme strongly resemles that of a branching enzyme), the corresponding catalytic (?/?)7-barrel is followed by a five-helix domain C, a small helical domain B being protruded out of the catalytic pseudo TIM barrel in the place of the loop 2 (i.e. succeeding the strand ?2). This structure was found to be closely similar to that of the GH57 member of unknown function from Thermus thermophilus (PDB ID 1ufa). Two structures of biochemically characterized branching enzymes were solved and published: one from Thermus thermophilus[8] (PDB ID 3p0b) and the other one from Thermococcus kodakaraensis (PDB ID 3n8t). The former study, importantly, is the first report to prove that a retaining mechanism is employed in the family GH57. In all cases, the catalytic glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues are located near the C-terminal ends of the strands ?4 and ?7 of the barrel, respectively. There was also a crystallization report in 1995 on a probable GH57 amylopullulanase from Pyrococcus woesei, but the detailed crystallographic analysis of this protein has not been published. It is clear that the C-terminal domain cannot be present in some GH57 members with shorter amino acid sequences, e.g., in the ?-galactosidases containing less than 400 residues. On the other hand, some other GH57 members, especially the extra-long amylopullulanases with more than 1,300 residues have to contain even additional domains. One of them could be a longer version of a typical surface layer homology (SLH) motif that was named as the so-called SLH motif-bearing domain in the amylopullulanase from Thermococcus hydrothermalis. This domain was found also in the GH15 glucodextranase fromArthrobacter globiformis. Remarkably, within the family GH57, the presence of this SLH motif-bearing domain is restricted only for amylopullulanases. It is also worth mentioning that, especially prior the first three-dimensional structure of a GH57 member was available, there were some efforts to join the family GH57 with the main ?-amylase family GH13, i.e. the present clan consisting of the families GH13, GH70 and GH77. Those efforts were focused mainly on looking for some remote homology at the sequence level only. Although both GH57 and GH-H employ the same retaining reaction mechanism the independence of the family GH57 with regard to GH-H clan is at present based not only on differences in the catalytic domain, but more importantly, on the differences in the catalytic machineries and conserved sequence regions. As far as other GH families are concerned, the family GH38 ?-mannosidase from Drosophila melanogaster was revealed to share some structural similarities within the catalytic domain with the GH57 4-?-glucanotransferase from Thermococcus litoralis indicating an eventuality of originating from a common ancestor.;;none;(?/?)7;alpha;retaining;anti;1kly;glucanotransferase;Thermococcus litoralis;acarbose;Asp214;Glu123;[45]
GH58;endo-N-acetylneuraminidase or endo-sialidase (EC 3.2.1.129);Glycoside hydrolases of family 58 are endo-N-acetylneuraminidases (also termed endo-sialidases). The capsular coat surrounding E. coli K1, is poly-?-2,8-sialic acid and protects the bacterium from the host immune system, but it also acts as an anchor point for bacteriophage infection. A range of bacteriophages specific to this E. coli capsule type have been described which have tailspike enzymes that degrade the capuslar material;Family 58 endo-sialidases are specific for polysialic acid and form a unique family of endo-acting sialidases, all others previously reported being exo-acting. The recently determined structure of an endo-sialidase derived from bacteriophage K1F (endoNF) revealed the active site to lack a number of the residues that are conserved in other sialidases, implying a new, endo-sialidase-specific catalytic mechanism. Using synthetic trifluoromethylumbelliferyl oligosialoside substrates kinetic parameters for hydrolysis at a single cleavage site were determined. Measurement of kcat/Km at a series of pH values revealed a dependence on a single protonated group of pKa 5. Direct 1H-NMR analysis of the hydrolysis of trifluoromethylumbelliferyl sialotrioside revealed that endoNF affects catalysis with an inverting mechanism.;From the crystal structure of the GH-58 enzyme it was noted that the normal catalyic residues found in exo-sialidases were not present. Instead, three conserved amino acids (Arg596, Arg647 and Glu581) were observed that contribute to endosialidase activity. Single mutations of those residues reduced the level of activity, but not enough to mark the residues as absolutely required. However, when double mutants were examined there was a complete loss of hydrolysis, but binding to PSA still occured. Since this enzyme proceeds with inverting stereochemistry, a catalytic base is implied by the mechanism, and Glu581 might fill that role.;The structure for the K1F tailspike enzyme has been solved by Stummeyer et al.. The protein structure is similar to other phage tailspike endo-hydrolases in that it is an extended, trimeric molecule. The first tailspike enzyme to be studied in detail was the endo-rhamnosidase from the Salmonella phage P22, which is in family GH90. The pictures here were generated in Pymol from PDB entry 1voe. Each monomer is a different colour to highlight the trimeric nature of the protein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GH62;?-L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55);"This small family of glycoside hydrolases comprises an equal number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes. All the characterized enzymes in this family are arabinofuranosidases that specifically cleave either ?-1,2 or ?-1,3-L-arabinofuranose side chains from xylans. The enzyme will not act on xylose moieties in xylan that are decorated at both O2 and O3 with an arabinose side chain. The enzyme also displays no non-specific arabinofuranosidase activity; for example it does not hydrolyse 4-nitrophenyl ?-L-arabinofuranoside. Several of these enzymes contain cellulose-[1] or xylan-[3] binding CBMs.";While the catalytic mechanism of this family have not been formerly determined, likely reflecting the extremely quick rate of mutarotation displayed by arabinose, the enzyme is predicted to display a single displacement or inverting mechanism. This prediction is based on the location of GH62 in clan F, the same clan occupied by GH43, which is an inverting family. Similarly, although the catalytic residues have not been determined using either biochemical or mutagenesis strategies, the identity of these residues is predicted from sequence homology with GH43 enzymes, given that both the catalytic mechanism and the catalytic apparatus are conserved in glycoside hydrolase families belonging to the same clan. Thus predicts that the catalytic general acid and general base will be a Glu and Asp, respectively, while a second Asp modulates the pKa of the general acid.;Predicted to be an Asp (general acid) and Glu (general base);Based on its location in clan F, enzymes from family GH62s are predicted to display a 5-fold ?-propeller fold;The enzymes in this family were originally classified as a glycoside hydrolase family based on measurement of very weak endo-1,4-b-D-glucanase activity in one family member. The structure and mode of action of these enzymes are certainly non-canonical and they cannot be considered as bona fide glycosidases.

GH63;"processing ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.106); ?-1,3-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.84); ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20)";Glycoside hydrolases of GH63 are exo-acting ?-glucosidases. Eukaryotic members of this family are processing ?-glucosidase I enzymes (mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.106), which specifically hydrolyze the terminal ?-1,2-glucosidic linkage in the N-linked oligosaccharide precursor, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, to produce ?-glucose and Glc2Man9GlcNAc2. Processing ?-glucosidase I thus plays a critical role in the maturation of eukaryotic N-glycans. The enzymatic properties of Cwh41p, a processing ?-glucosidase I from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been intensively studied (also reviewed in). Genes encoding GH63 enzymes have also been found in archaea and bacteria, but their natural substrates are still unclear, as these organisms are not known to produce eukaryotic N-linked oligosacharides. A bacterial GH63 enzyme, Escherichia coliYgjK, demonstrated the highest activity toward the ?-1,3-glucosidic linkage of nigerose (Glc-?-1,3-Glc) among the commercially available sugars tested.;Family GH63 enzymes are inverting enzymes, as first shown by NMR on a processing ?-glucosidase I from S. cerevisiae.;The catalytic residues were inferred by comparing the catalytic (?/?)6 barrel domain of the GH63 enzyme, E. coli YgjK, with those of GH15 and GH37 enzymes. In the case of GH37 and GH63, both of which belong to clan GH-G, the catalytic general acid is predicted as an Asp residue (Asp501 in E. coli YgjK), and the general base is considered to be a Glu residue (Glu727 in E. coli YgjK). Although both of the corresponding residues of GH15, which belongs to clan GH-L, are identified as Glu residues, the positions of the catalytic residues of GH15, GH37, and GH63 are highly conserved.;The crystal structures of the bacterial GH63 proteins, E. coli YgjK (multiple PDB entries) and Thermus thermophilus uncharacterised protein TTHA0978 (PDB 2z07), have been reported. The catalytic domain consists of an (?/?)6 barrel fold. The main chain of the (?/?)6 barrel domain shares high structural similarity with those of GH15, GH37, GH65, and GH94. This similarity had been predicted on the basis of sequence comparison, before their crystal structures were available.;;G;(?/?)6;alpha;inverting;predicted anti by clan;see at GH37;;;;unknown;unknown;

GH65 contains mainly phosphorylases; maltose (Glc-?-1,4-Glc) phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.8), trehalose (Glc-?1,?1-Glc) phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.64), kojibiose (Glc-?-1,2-Glc) phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.230), and trehalose 6-phosphate (Glc-?1,?1-Glc6P) phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.-). Notably ?,?-trehalases (EC 3.2.1.28), which a glycoside hydrolases, are also GH65 members.";Phosphorolysis by GH65 enzymes proceeds with inversion of anomeric configuration, as first shown by Fitting and Doudoroff using maltose phosphorylase from Neisseria meningitidis, i.e. the reaction catalyzed is: maltose + Pi ? ?-glucose 1-phosphate + glucose. The reaction mechanism for inverting GH65 phosphorylase has been proposed to be similar to a general acid/base-catalysed one-step displacement mechanism for inverting glycoside hydrolases. This mechanism involves direct nucleophilic attack by phosphate on the anomeric (C1) carbon assisted by general acid catalysis involving protonation of the glycosidic oxygen. In this mechanism, phosphate is the nucleophile, rather than a water molecule activated by a general base catalyst as in inverting glycoside hydrolases. The possibility of general base assistance in the phosphorylases of this family, via a histidine residue proximal to the phosphate nucleophile, is also suggested. The inverting phosphorolysis catalyzed by GH65 enzyme is readily reversible, which confers the phosphorylases with a capacity to effectively synthesize various ?-glucosides from ?-glucose 1-phosphate as a glycosyl donor, together with various acceptor molecules. Notably ?-glucosyl fluoride can also be used as donor in synthetic reactions.;The general acid catalyst was first predicted by superimposing the active site structure of maltose phosphorylase from Lactobacillus brevis with the catalytic (?/?)6 barrel domain of a GH15 glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.28) from Aspergillus awamori. Considering the similarities of the active site structure, Glu487 of L. brevis maltose phosphorylase was proposed to be the general acid. Additional support for this assignment was obtained by site-direct mutagenesis of Glu487 of Paenibacillus sp. maltose phosphorylase, which corresponds to the Glu487 of L. brevis maltose phosphorylase. A histidine located near the phosphate (His671 in L. brevis maltose phosphorylase) may assist catalysis by acting as a general base, but no experimental evidence has yet been provided.;The three-dimensional structure of L. brevis maltose phosphorylase (PDB ID 1h54) represents the first determined in this family. L. brevis maltose phosphorylase is a dimeric enzyme (Figure 1). The monomer structure consists of an N-terminal complex ? sandwich domain, a helical linker, an (?/?)6 barrel catalytic domain, and a C-terminal ? sheet domain. The structure of the (?/?)6 barrel domain is similar to those of GH15 glucoamylases (EC 3.2.1.28). GH15 and GH65 together constitute glycoside hydrolase Clan GH-L.

GH67;"?-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.139); xylan ?-1,2-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.131)";Glycoside hydrolases of this family display alpha-glucuronidase activity. The enzymes target the glucuronic acid appended to the C2-OH of the xylose at the non-reducing end of xylooligosaccharides. The enzymes display a preference for 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid side chains. The length of the oligosaccharide does not influence catalytic rate indicating that the enzyme only interacts with the uronic acid and the linked xylose. These enzymes do not remove glucuronic acid from internal regions of xylan. The enzymes are generally intracellular or membrane associated suggesting that they play a terminal role in uncapping decorated xyloooligosaccharides, making these molecules available to beta-xylosidases produced by the host.;Alpha-glucuronidases are inverting enzymes that hydrolyse their target glycoside bond through a single displacement mechanism assisted by general acid and general base residues. Thus the glucuronic acid is formed in a beta configuration.;Typical of inverting glycoside hydrolases, GH67 enzymes contain a general acid that protonates the scissile glycosidic oxygen promoting leaving group departure. This residue, Glu292 in the Cellvibrio japonicus GH67 and Glu285 in the Geobacillus stearothermophilus GH67 enzymes is a conserved glutamate within GH67. There are a pair of carboxylic acids that make hydrogen bonds with the catalytic water (attacks the anomeric carbon of the scissile glycosidic bond), and are predicted to activate the solvent molecule, thus acting as the general base. Which of these highly conserved residues, Glu393/Asp365 and Glu392/Asp364 in the C. japonicus and G. stearothermophilus enzymes, respectively, act as the general base is unclear. Mutational studies suggested that Asp365 in the C. japonicus enzyme may be the catalytic base, although similar mutagenesis studies on the Geobacillus glucuronidase indicate that mutation of either possible catalytic bases results in almost complete inactivation of the enzyme.;"GH67 enzymes contain three distinct domains. The N-terminal domain forms a two-layer ? sandwich, the central domain, the catalytic domain, is a classical (?/?)8 barrel whose catalytic center is located on the opposite, ""C-terminal"" side of the barrel to the N-terminal domain. The remaining, C-terminal domain is mainly ?-helical. It wraps around the catalytic domain, making additional interactions both with the N-terminal domain of its parent monomer and also forming the majority of the dimer-surface with the equivalent C-terminal domain of the other monomer of the dimer.

GH68;"levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10); ?-fructofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.26); inulosucrase (EC 2.4.1.9).";"Glycoside hydrolase family 68 enzymes include levansucrase (sucrose:2,6-?-D-fructan 6-?-D-fructosyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.10), ?-fructofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.26), and inulosucrase (EC 2.4.1.9). All these enzymes use sucrose as their preferential donor substrate. Many of them can create very long levan-type fructans (catalyzed by levansucrases) or inulin-type of fructans (catalyzed by inulosucrases), as well as fructooligosacharides (FOS). However, some GH68 enzymes can also use fructan as donor substrate (in the abscence of sucrose or at a high fructan/sucrose ratio).";Family GH68 enzymes as well as those included in GH32 are retaining enzymes. The levansucrases from Bacillus subtilis, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, and Streptococcus salivarius catalyze transfructosylation via a ping-pong mechanism involving the formation of a transient fructosyl-enzyme intermediate. At low sucrose concentrations levansucrase functions as a hydrolase with water as acceptor, whereas at higher substrate concentrations it adds fructosyl units to a variety of acceptors including glucose, fructan and sucrose. Bacterial levansucrases, whatever their origin, catalyze all these reactions but with different efficiency.;"GH68 retaining enzymes catalyze hydrolysis in two steps involving a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate. The two invariant residues, responsible for the catalytic reaction in family GH68 enzymes, have first been identified experimentally in bacterial levansucrases as an aspartate located close to the N-terminus acting as the catalytic nucleophile and a glutamate acting as the general acid/base. In addition, a conserved aspartate residue in the ""Arg-Asp-Pro (RDP) motif"" stabilizes the transition state. The three equivalent acidic residues have been mutated in a ?-fructofuranosidase from Arthrobacter globiformis IFO 3062, and in a levansucrase and a inulosucrase from Lactobacillus reuteri 121.";Currently, only four different three dimensional structures of family GH68 enzymes have been solved. The first crystal structure was reported for the bacterial levansucrase (SacB) from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168. The second one corresponds to levansucrase (LdsA) from Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4, the third corresponds to SacB from Bacillus megaterium, and the last one corresponds to inulosucrase (InuJ) from Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533. These structures display a 5-fold ?-propeller topology, and therefore GH families 68 and 32 have been combined in clan GH-J.

GH73;peptidoglycan hydrolase with endo-?-N-acetylglucosaminidase specificity (EC 3.2.1.-);Family GH73 contains bacterial and viral glycoside hydrolases. Most of the enzymes of this family cleave the ?-1,4-glycosidic linkage between N-acetylglucosaminyl (NAG) and N-acetylmuramyl (NAM) moieties in the carbohydrate backbone of bacterial peptidoglycans. Because of their cleavage specificity, they are commonly described as ?-N-acetylglucosaminidases. The enzymes from family GH73 are mainly involved in daughter cell separation during vegetative growth, and they often hydrolyze the septum after cell division (Acp from Clostridium perfringens, AltA from Enterococcus faecalis). Occasionally GH73 enzymes are used during host-cell invasion such as the virulence-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase Auto from Listeria monocytogenes. GH73 enzymes are mostly surface-located and often exhibit repeated sequences that could be involved in bacterial cell-wall binding (figure 1). Unknown repeated domains are appended for instance to LytD and LytG from Bacillus subtilis, AcmB fromLactococcus lactis, and Auto from L. monocytogene. Some of these repeated domains have been identified such as the carbohydrate-binding modules of family CBM50 (also known as LysM domains) appended for instance to AcmA of Lactococcus lactis[7], AltA from Enterococcus faecalis and Mur2-Mur2 from Enterococcus hirae.;No kinetic parameters have been determined for any enzyme of the GH73 family, as the production of synthetic peptidoglycan substrates remains a challenge.;"The catalytic general acid is a glutamate, strictly conserved in the GH73 family. Its catalytic role has been evidenced in FlgJ, Auto, AcmA and AltWN. Glu185 in FlgJ and Glu122 in Auto have also been identified through structural comparison with the actives sites of GH19, GH22 and GH23 enzymes. However, in contrast to GH22 lysozymes, the structures of FlgJ and Auto both lack a nearby second catalytic carboxylate such as Asp52 in hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), which represents thecatalytic nucleophile (see figure 3). Interestingly this amino acid is strictly conserved in the sequences of GH73 enzymes but it is situated 13? away from the Glu general acid in the active site. The identification of the catalytic nucleophile/base is not conclusive. On one hand, the mutations of the putative distant nucleophile Glu156 in Auto and Glu224 in FlgJ were accompanied of a large decrease in the catalytic activity, compatible with the role of a base activating a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack on the opposite side of the sugar ring (inverting mechanism). On the other hand, significant residual activity was found when the putative nucleophile/base residue of AcmA and AltWN were converted to glutamine or asparagine (for Asp1275 in AltWN), which is more compatible with a substrate-assisted catalysis (also termed ""neighboring group participation"" mechanism) involving anchimeric assistance by the acetamido group of the GlcNAc moiety. In such mechanism a neighbouring tyrosine is frequently involved. In family GH73, a Tyr residue is highly conserved (Fig2: Tyr220 in Auto), in close proximity to the catalytic general acid Glu. Substitution of this Tyr residue in FlgJ, AcmA and AltWN was associated with a reduced activity similar to that resulting from the mutation of the general acid Glu. The neighboring group participation mechanism involving the general acid Glu and the Tyr as essential catalytic residues found support from the sequence comparison of family GH73 with families GH20, GH18, GH23 and GH56, which do not have a catalytic nucleophile residue.";Crystal structures of GH73 are available and have been reported simultaneously, namely FlgJ from Sphingomonas sp. (SPH1045-C) and Auto a virulence associated peptigoglycan hydrolase from Listeria monocytogenes. The two GH73 show the same fold, with two subdomains consisting of a ?-lobe and an ?-lobe that together create an extended substrate binding groove (Figure 2). With a typical lysozyme (?+?) fold, the catalytic domain of Auto is structurally related to the catalytic domain of Slt70 from E. coli, the family GH19 chitinases and goose egg-white lysozyme (GEWL, GH23). FlgJ is structurally related to a peptidoglycan degrading enzyme from the bacteriophage phi 29 and also to family GH22 and GH23 lysozymes.;"The 3-D structure of Sphingomonas sp. strain A1 FlgJ protein of this family has recently been solved (Hashimotoa et al., BBRC 2009, in press); there is only one, unconfirmed, report of b-1,4-N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase (EC 3.2.1.17) activity";;;;unknown;;;;;;Glu;unknown;

Cel74 from Thermotoga maritima exhibits the highest activity on barley ?-glucan, with relative activity of 20% toward xyloglucan. A wide diversity in the modes of action by GH74 enzymes has been reported. ""Oligoxyloglucan reducing end-specific cellobiohydrolase (OXG-RCBH, EC 3.2.1.150)"" from Geotrichum sp.

Characterized GH80 members do not hydrolyze chitin or cellulose, and for one member, the chitosan hexa-oligosaccharide (GlcN)6 is preferentially hydrolyzed into two molecules of the trisaccharide;The stereochemistry of the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by GH80 members has not yet been studied. However, sequence similarity with members of Clan GH-I suggests that these enzymes may operate with inversion of the anomeric configuration ;The chitosanases from family GH80 share a PROSITE signature motif with the chitosanases from family GH46. Together with GH24, these three families comprise clan GH-I. A site-directed mutagenesis study of the chitosanase A from Matsuebacter chitosanotabidus 3001 (new name: Mitsuaria chitosanitabida) identified two residues as essentiel for catalysis: Glu-121 (in the sequence YPENG)and Glu-141 (in the sequence DYEAA);o three-dimensional structure has yet been solved for this family. As a member of clan GH-I, a lysozyme-like ?-? fold is suggested, based on known GH24 and GH46 structures.;;I;? + ?;beta;inverting;predicted syn by clan;see at GH24;;;;;;

GH82;?-carrageenase (EC 3.2.1.157);All characterised members of glycoside hydrolase family 82 enzymes cleave the ?-1,4 galactosidic bond of the marine algal polysaccharide iota-carrageenan yielding products of the neocarrabiose series.;Family 82 enzymes operate with an inverting mechanism, as first shown by NMR on the iota-carrageenase from Alteromonas fortis. The reaction seems to involve a chloride ion which through the Glu222 participated in the polarisation of the catalytic water molecule.;From structural analysis the catalytic residues have been predicted to be two out of the three candidate amino acids Glu245, Asp247 or Glu310 in the A. fortis iota-carrageenase. A study in 2010, which utilized site directed mutagenesis, has confirmed that Glu245 plays the role of the general acid residue in this inverting enzyme, and Asp247 is the general base activating the nucleophilic water molecule. However, intriguingly the position of equivalent residues to Asp247 in other iota-carrageenase sequences are not strictly conserved.;A crystal structure has only been determined for the iota-carrageenase from A. fortis and the protein folds into a right-handed parallel ?-helix of 10 complete turns with two additional C-terminal domains (A and B). The crystal structure of a product complex has shed light on the existence of domain movement of domain A that is closed around the oligo-carrageenan in the complexed form and open in the uncomplexed enzyme (Figure 1). Recent discovery of shorter sequences indicates the existence of enzymes devoid of the C-terminal domain A or both domains A and B.;;;( ? )-helix;;inverting;;;;;;Glu;Asp;

GH84;"N-acetyl ?-glucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52); hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35);-3-O-(GlcNAc)-L-Ser/Thr ?-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.169)";Glycoside hydrolases of GH84 include ?-N-acetylglucosaminidases but members have often also been annotated as ?-N-acetylhyaluronidases. This second annotation arises from the initial cloning of the enzyme and its early sequence analysis, which suggested sequence similarity to ?-N-acetylhyaluronidases. Biochemical analysis of a GH84 enzyme annotated in as a hyaluronidase, however, revealed that it had no such activity and structural studies of other homologues have suggested the active site would be unable to process polymeric hyaluronan. Humans possess only one enzyme belonging to GH84, first defined by its unique biochemical properties including activity at neutral pH and selectivity for N-acetylglucosamine residues. The human GH84 enzyme was labelled as HexC to distinguish it from the human GH20 lysosomal enzymes HexA and HexB. HexC was first cloned from a meningoma library using autologous serum and defined as meningoma expressed antigen 5 (MGEA5). It was later cloned and biochemically characterized as O-GlcNAcase, a nuclear and cytoplasmic enzyme targeting glycoprotein substrates modified by ?-linked GlcNAc residues linked to serine and threonine residues. A truncated, nuclear-localized isoform of human O-GlcNAcase lacking a putative C-terminal histone acetyl transferase domain retains similar kinetic properties (aside from a much lower activity) and inhibition patterns as the full-length cytosolic isoform and is consistent with hexosaminidase activity residing in the N-terminal domain, which shares similarity with other GH84 enzymes. In contrast to the ?-hexosaminidases of GH20 a relaxed specificity for substitutions of the N-acyl group is observed with residues significantly more bulky than the N-acyl group being tolerated.;"Members of GH84 are retaining enzymes that use a catalytic mechanism of neighboring group participation, this originally being established through the use of free-energy relationship-based studies of human O-GlcNAcase. More recent studies of the human enzyme have investigated variations in rates of reaction (V/K) with both nucleophile and leaving group structures. For substrates possessing the naturally-occurring acetyl nucleophile a pre-chemical step is rate-determining on V/K for leaving groups with a pKa below 11 (with the chemical step rate-determining for substrates with higher pKa values). Studies of substrates possessing fluoroacetyl nucleophiles highlighted that a dissociative (DN*AN) mechanism involving general acid catalysis operates for the hydrolysis of substrates possessing leaving groups with a pKa greater than approximately 7; a concerted (ANDN) mechanism, not employing general acid catalysis was found for substrates possessing leaving groups with lower pKa values (consistent with prior studies showing hydrolysis of 1-S-glucosaminides). Numerous carbohydrate and carbohydrate like-scaffolds have been reported as potent inhibitors of GH84 enzymes. These include ""NAG-thiazolines"", PUGNAc (O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate), GlcNAcstatins, 6-epi-valeinamines, and 6-acetamido-6-deoxy-castanospermine. The greater tolerance of the N-acyl binding pockets of GH84 enzymes for bulky sidechains compared to those of GH20 enzymes has enabled the development of inhibitors that are not only highly potent but also highly selective in their inhibition of human nucleocytoplasmic O-GlcNAcase (GH84) over human lysosomal ?-hexosaminidases. Many of these families of inhibitors possess structural characteristics reminiscent of the oxocarbenium ion-like transition states of glycosyl group transfer and, as such may loosely be termed 'transition state analogues'. An analysis of NAG-thiazoline- and PUGNAc-derived inhibitors of human O-GlcNAcase has shown that only the NAG-thiazolines position the inhibitors and their N-acyl side-chains within the hydrophobic binding pocket in a manner consistent with the species found along the reaction coordinate. As such NAG-thiazoline inhibitors may be termed 'Bartlett-type' (free-energy relationship-based) transition state analogues. Significantly streptozotocin, a widely used diabetogenic compound whose toxicity towards pancreatic ?-cells was hypothesized to arise from its ability to act as an inhibitor of human O-GlcNAcase, neither binds covalently to GH84 enzymes, nor is a particularly potent inhibitor of human O-GlcNAcase.";Studies of two mutants of human O-GlcNAcase established that adjacent aspartate residues, Asp174 and Asp175, act as critical components of the catalytic machinery of this enzyme. The mutant Asp175Ala displayed marked reductions in activity (V and (V/K)) towards aryl N-acetylglucosaminides possessing poor leaving groups with smaller reductions being observed for both O-aryl and S-aryl N-acetylglucosaminides substrates possessing better leaving groups. Exogenous azide was found to partially rescue the activity of human O-GlcNAcase towards 3,4-dinitrophenylglucosaminide. These results clearly identified Asp175 as the general acid catalyst. The mutant Asp174Ala showed significantly decreased activity towards O-aryl N-acetylglucosaminides possessing either good or poor leaving groups and it was argued that this is consistent with its role as a residue responsible for the orientation and polarization of the N-acyl nucleophile.;"The reported crystallization of Clostridium perfringens NagJ (CpOGA) was followed by solved structures for that enzyme and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ?-glucosaminidase (BtOGA). In common with the chitinases of family GH18 and the exo-acting ?-hexosaminidases of GH20 the catalytic domain is a (??)8-barrel structure. The structure of human O-GlcNAcase has not been solved but both bacterial homologues are good models of both the active site and catalytic domain of human O-GlcNAcase. More recently the structure of the GH84 ?-hexosaminidase from Oceanicola granulosus has been solved and shown to possess good sequence identity with the catalytic domain of the human enzyme. Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of this protein also displays notable sequence identity with the spacer domain, which separates the domains possessing O-GlcNAcase and histone acetyltransferase activities) of the human enzyme. A series of crystallographic studies on Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ?-hexosaminidase have used a variety of small molecules to define the conformational itinerary for this family of enzymes. Substrate distortion from the stable 4C1conformation found in solution to a bound 1,4B / 1S3 conformation was supported by the crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme in complex with 6-acetamido-6-deoxy-castanospermine and the 7-membered ring-containing azepane. This distortion was confirmed by the structure the wild-type enzyme in complex with the substrate 3,4-difluorophenyl 2-deoxy-2-difluoroacetamido-?-D-glucopyranoside. Early studies of the wild-type BtOGA-bound thiazoline show that this intermediate is found in a 4C1conformation; subsequent studies have shown that oxazoline intermediates are bound in this conformation to BtOGA active site mutants.";Mechanism shown in Macauley et al.

GH85;endo-?-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.96);Endo-?-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGse) are glycoside hydrolases that cleave the chitobiose core (GlcNAc-?-1,4-GlcNac) of N-linked glycans. Examples of ENGases have been shown to be active on high-mannose type N-glycans (Endo-H, Endo-A, Endo-Fsp, Endo-F1, Endo-D and Endo-E), bi- and tri-antennary complex type N-glycans (Endo-F2 and Endo-F3), and both substrates (Endo-M) and belong to glycoside hydrolase families 18 and 85. Although specificity appears to be primarily determined by the oligosaccharide glycone, there is evidence that structural features within the carbohydrate-protein aglycone region (GlcNAc-Asn) may also play a role in substrate recognition. GH85s, represented by Endo-D, Endo-A, and Endo-M, are broadly distributed in nature having been described in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. In several cases, including Endo-A from Arthrobacter protophormiae (ApGH85) and Endo-M from Mucor hiemalis (MhGH85), ENGases have been shown to catalyze transglycosylation reactions, making them useful candidates in the bioengineering of glycoproteins and biologic pharmaceuticals.;Enzymes of family GH85 are retaining enzymes and are proposed to utilize neighboring group participation in a mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis by the 2-acetamido group of the sugar. This mechanism was proposed on the basis of the identification of a highly conserved catatlytic acid-base E173 in Endo-A and transglycosylation reactions that deployed oxazoline substrates as donor sugars. Further support was provided by the three-dimensional structure of Endo-A and Endo-D in complex with thiazoline-based inhibitors. NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor the Endo-D catalyzed cleavage of a synthetic aryl glycoside to demonstrate retention of the anomeric configuration. GH85s appear to deploy a rare form of substrate-assisted catalysis as a candidate asparagine, operating in an imidic tautomer form, facilitates a “proton shuttle” that results in acid-base catalysis of the glycosidic bond, a role similar to the catalytic aspartates in Glycoside Hydrolase Family 18 and Glycoside Hydrolase Family 56.;"Exploiting the transglycosylation capabilities of Endo-M from M. hiemalis, three residues were identified by site directed mutagenesis to be central to the catalytic reaction: N175, E177, and Y217. Mutation of the tyrosine to phenylalanine diminished hydrolytic capability but enhanced transglycosylation. The role of N175 was demonstrated to be fundamental for hydrolysis as substitution with alanine ablated hydrolysis; however, transglycosylation could be performed using oxazoline substrates. Interactions between homologous asparagines residues in Endo-A (N171) and Endo-D (N335) were confirmed by structural studies, which observed each in contact with the modified 2-acetamido group of NAG-thiazoline inhibitors. E177 operates as the catalytic acid and donates a protein to the glycosidic oxygen, which is a conserved role with E173 of Endo-A.";;;K;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;anti;2w92;endo-?-N-acetyl- glucosaminidase D;Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4;NAG-thiazoline;Glu337;internal;[52]
GH86;?-agarase (EC 3.2.1.81);Glycoside hydrolases of family 86 are ?-agarases (EC 3.2.1.81) that cleave ?-1,4 glycosidic bonds of agarose. As of November 2010, only three enzymes have been characterized: AgrA from Pseudoalteromonas atlantica, AgaO from Microbulbifer thermotolerans JAMB-A94 and Aga86E from Saccharophagus degradans 2-40. AgaO from M. thermotolerans was reported to be an endo-hydrolytic enzyme, releasing neoagaro-hexaose as main product, while the recombinant Aga86E from S. degradans released only neoagarobiose in an exo-acting manner.;A potential retaining mechanism of this glycoside hydrolase family can only be inferred from analogy to clan GH-A enzymes. No mechanistic or kintetic analysis demonstrating the stereochemical outcome of the reaction have been reported for this family to date;Actually, the catalytic residues can only be inferred from analogy to clan GH-A enzymes as two glutamate residues.;No 3D structure is available to date.;;A;(?/?)8;beta;retaining;predicted anti by clan;see e.g. at GH1;;;;Glu;Glu;

GH89;?-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.50);Family 89 glycoside hydrolases are ?-N-acetylglucosaminidases. The human lysosomal enzyme, NAGLU, is involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate. Mutations in this enzyme can cause a devastating disease called Sanfilippo syndrome type B which is also called mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB.;Mechanistic and structural data is available on CpGH89, a family 89 glycoside hydrolase produced by Clostridium perfringens. CpGH89 uses a classical Koshland retaining mechanism to hydrolyze the glycosidic bond. This results in hydrolysis with a net retention of stereochemistry at the anomeric carbon.;Two catalytically important glutamate residues have been identified in CpGH89, Glu483 and Glu601. These residues are between 6.1-6.7? apart, which is consistent with a retaining catalytic mechanism. Mutation of Glu601 to an alanine results in an apparent abolishment of activity suggesting this residue is active as the catalytic nucleophile. Glu601 resides below the A-face of the sugar ring and is 2.8-3.1? from C1 and appears suitably placed for nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon. Mutation of Glu483 to alanine results in much less severe impairments in catalysis suggesting this residue is active as the general acid/base residue. Glu483 is ~3.6? from C1 and appears to be positioned in such a way that it would be capable of forming a hydrogen bond with the glycosidic oxygen of the substrate.;The three dimensional structure is available for CpGH89, see PDB entries 2vc9, 2vca, 2vcb and 2vcc. CpGH89 is a multi-modular protein and quite large (2095 amino acids). Only residues 26-916 were crystallized. The N-terminal domain (residues 26-155) forms a ?-sandwich fold and shares sequence identity to the family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). This module is tightly packed against the rest of the protein through a number of hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. The catalytic region is comprised of a small mixed ?/? domain (residues 170-280), a decorated (?/?)8 core (residues 280-620), and an all ?-helical domain (residues 621-916).;;none;(?/?)8;alpha;retaining;anti;2vcb;?-N-acetyl- glucosaminidase;Clostridium perfringens;PUGNAc;Glu483;Glu601;[53]

Indeed, polysaccharide cleavage in some members occurs via intramolecular hydroxide attack, rather than glycosidic bond hydrolysis (see EC 4.2.2.17 and EC 4.2.2.18). The family was placed back to Glycoside Hydrolase Family 91 on 20 April 2010 due to direct analogy with the lytic transglycosidases of GH23, GH102, GH103, and GH104 and in particular the observation of a hydrolase (di-fructofuranose 1,2':2,3' dianhydride hydrolase, DFA-IIIase) in this family.;;?-helix;;inverting;;;;;;;;

The first reported enzyme activity from this family was an ?-1,2-mannosidase from Microbacterium sp. M-90. Recently the characterization of 22 GH92 enzymes from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron confirmed an exo-mode of action with ?-1,2-mannosidase, ?-1,3-mannosidase, ?-1,4-mannosidase and ?-1,6-mannosidase activities were detected.;1H NMR studies on three GH92s that displayed ?-1,2-, ?-1,3- and ?-1,4-mannosidase activities all generated ?-mannose indicating that these enzymes catalyse glycosidic bond hydrolysis through a single displacement mechanism leading to inversion of anomeric configuration. GH92 enzymes are Ca2+-dependent ?-mannosidases. The requirement for the metal ion is currently restricted to only three GH families all of which are exo-?-mannosidases: GH38, GH47 and GH92. Mechanistically this may indicate that the lack of distorting binding energy provided by the -2 or +1 subsites impose a requirement for conformational flexibility at the -1 subsite (recognition of the ground state and the transition state conformations), which is achieved by a metal ion interaction with O2 and O3. Three inhibitors bound to the ?-1,2-mannosidase Bt3990 in approximate 1S5/B2,5 and 1,4B/1S5 conformations indicating that catalysis is proceeds via a B2,5 transition state.;Based on 3D structural data on the ?-1,2-mannosidase Bt3990, Glu533 is the predicted general acid. This view is supported by an inactive mutant of this residue, and the conservation of the glutamate throughout the GH92 family. The general base, in common with many inverting glycoside hydrolases, is more difficult to identify. Asp644 and Asp642 both lie in the canonical position expected for a general base in an inverting enzyme. Mutants of both residues inactivte the enzyme, however, while Asp644 is invariant, Asp642 can be an Asn or Asp in GH92 members. It appears that Asp644 is the likely catalytic general base.;GH92 enzymes display a two domain structure.

GH93;exo-?-L-1,5-arabinanase (EC 3.2.1.-);The characterized glycoside hydrolases of family GH93 are known to hydrolyse linear ?-1,5-L-arabinan., EC:3.2.1-.;GH93 enzymes are exo-acting enzymes that only release arabinobiose from the non-reducing end of ?-1,5-L-arabinan. These enzymes are proposed to be retaining enzymes based on the net retention of the configuration of the anomeric carbon is proposed from the products of the transglycosylation activity of the protein Abnx from Penicillium chrysogenum. This proposal obtained support from the crystal structures of the Arb93A enzyme from Fusarium graminearum and Abnx both in complex with arabinobiose. ?-L-Arabinofuranosylated pyrrolidines were shown to be good inhibitors of Arb93A. The Arb93A complex structure with a deoxyiminosugar equivalent of arabinobiose revealed a 4TN twist conformation expected for the Michaelis complex, as seen for several retaining GH51 ?-L-arabinofuranosidases.;From the crystal structure of Arb93A, Glu170 and Glu242 are proposed to act as catalytic nucleophile and general acid/base respectively. Mutagenesis experiment support their role in catalysis and they are strictly conserved among the family members. Recent structures and mutagenesis studies for the arabinanase Abnx from Penicillium chrysogenum 31B strengthened this assignment. Mutations to alanine or glutamine of their equivalent Glu174 and Glu246 lead to inactive enzyme.;The crystal structure of Arb93A reveals a six-bladed ?-propeller fold characteristic of sialidases of clan GH-E., The catalytic machinery is however very different from that of sialidases.;;E;6-fold ?-propeller;alpha;retaining;predicted anti by clan;see e.g. at GH33;;;;Glu;Glu;

The substrate specificities found in GH94 are: cellobiose (Glc-?1,4-Glc) phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.20), cellodextrin ((Glc-?1,4-)n-1Glc; n ? 3) phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.49), and N,N’-diacetyl chitobiose (GlcNAc-?1,4-GlcNAc) phosphorylase. Moreover, a phosphorylase domain belonging to this family is found in cyclic ?-1,2-glucan synthase, a modular protein that also contains a glycosyltransferase domain from Glycosyltransferase Family 84. The GH94 domain is thought to phosphorolyze protein-bound ?-1,2-glucans synthesized from UDP-glucose by the GT84 domain. GH94 enzymes were initially classified in Glycosyltransferase Family 36 because none of them show hydrolytic activity. However because of the evolutionary, structural and mechanistic relatedness with clan GH-L glycoside hydrolases, the family was re-assigned to family GH94.";"Phosphorolysis by GH94 enzymes proceeds with inversion of anomeric configuration, as first shown by Sih and McBee on cellobiose phosphorylase from Clostridium thermocellum, i.e. cellobiose (Glc-?1,4-Glc) + Pi ? ?-glucose 1-phosphate + glucose; these are therefore inverting enzymes. Considering the topology of the active site structure, the reaction mechanism for inverting phosphorylases is proposed to be similar to that for inverting GHs. With the aid of a general acid residue, enzymatic phosphorolysis begins with direct nucleophilic attack by phosphate on the anomeric C-1 carbon, instead of the water molecule activated by a general base residue, as in inverting GH reaction.";The general acid residue was first elucidated by superimposing the active site structure of chitobiose phosphorylase from Vibrio proteolyticus with a Glycoside Hydrolase Family 15 enzyme, glucoamylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum. Considering the similarities of the active site structure, Asp492 was identified as the general acid residue. D492A/N mutants of this enzyme showed no detectable activity.

GH95;"?-1,2-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.63); ?-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51)";"Glycoside hydrolases of GH95 are exclusively 1,2-?-L-fucosidases (EC 3.2.1.63) that hydrolyze Fuc?1-2Gal linkages attached at the non-reducing ends of oligosaccharides. Such structures are found in human milk oligosaccharides (2'-fucosyllactose; Fuc?1-2Gal?1-4Glc) and blood group glycoconjugates (ABO and Lewis antigens) and are also found as branching residues on the plant polysaccharide xyloglucan (see below). An 1,2-?-L-fucosidase from Bifidobacterium bifidum (BbAfcA) cannot hydrolyze the fucosyl linkage when the Gal residue is further modified, i.e. the enzyme does not act on blood group A- and B-trisaccharides (see for structures). 3-Fucosyllactose, Gal?1-4(Fuc?1-3)Glc, is slightly hydrolyzed by the BbAfcA. 1,2-?-L-Fucosidases from Arabidopsis thaliana and Lilium longiflorum (lily) can liberate L-fucose from xyloglucan fragment XXFG as well as 2'-fucosyllactose, but does not liberate L-fucose from 3-fucosyllactose. Both BbAfcA and the plant enzymes do not act on other linkages and artificial substrates such as 4'-nitrophenyl-?-L-fucoside.";Hydrolysis catalyzed by this family of the enzymes proceeds via an inverting mechanism, as first shown by Katayama et al. using 1H-NMR. The best characterized member of this family is the 1,2-?-L-fucosidase from Bifidobacterium bifidum (BbAfcA). The kcat and Km values of BbAfcA for 2'-fucosyllactose, Fuc?1-2Gal?1-4Glc, were determined to be 0.091 mM and 160 s-1, respectively.;GH95 enzymes are considered to employ a unique reaction mechanism, in which Asp-activated Asn acts as a general base catalyst while the role of the general acid catalyst is played by a canonical carboxylic residue, Glu. In BbAfcA, Glu566 and Asn423 have been identified as the general acid and general base residues, respectively. Glu566 is hydrogen-bonded with Asn421, and this hydrogen bond is thought to be important in orienting the side chain of Glu566 toward the oxygen atom (O2) of the departing Gal. Asn423 is activated by the neighboring Asp766, and consequently activates a nucleophilic water molecule. This model (carboxylic acid-mediated activation of amido group) bears some analogy to the neighboring group participation mechanism employed by members of GH18, GH20, GH25, GH56, GH84 and GH85. These four residues are invariable in the members of this family, and substitution with alanine or glycine diminishes activities by 1,000- to 10,000-fold[4].;The first solved 3D structure was of the catalytic domain (aa. 577-1474 of 1959) of BbAfcA (PDB ID 2eab WT in apo form, PDB ID 2eac WT in compex with deoxyfuconojirimycin, PDB ID 2ead E566A in complex with 2'-fucosyllactose, PDB ID 2eae D766A in complex with fucose and lactose).

The ?-glucosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has been characterised in the most detail, and has been demonstrated to hydrolyse substrates ranging from maltose to maltoheptaose in length, and those containing ?-1,6-, ?-1,3- and ?-1,2-, as well as ?-1,4-linkages.";Family GH97 is unusual as it contains both retaining and inverting enzymes, as shown unequivocally by NMR and HPLC analyses, by characterization of two enzymes from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Catalysis is dependent on the presence of calcium, which coordinates the C2-OH group of the substrate in the -1 subsite, as well as four glutamate residues in the active site. One of the glutamate residues coordinated by the calcium ion is predicted to be the general acid/base residue, which may receive acid assistance from the calcium during hydrolysis.;"The constellation of glutamate residues (five in total, four of which coordinate the calcium ion) in the active site of the only (inverting) GH97 enzyme whose structure has been solved to date, has made the assignment of catalytic residues difficult. Analysis of sequence alignments, structural alignments with family GH27, and a mutant tested with substrates with different leaving group abilities, has provided a likely candidate for the general acid residue in this inverting enzyme or as the general acid/base in the retaining members of the family. It is possible that the calcium ion provides acid assistance to the acid/base during hydrolysis. The general base for the inverting enzyme has also been predicted on the basis of its position in the active site; in addition it coordinates a water molecule that is situated in a position primed for nucleophilic attack, and mutation causes the enzyme to be virtually inactive. Although a structure has not been solved for a retaining enzyme, the catalytic nucleophile for the retaining enzymes has been predicted based on sequence alignments, and similarity to GH27 enzymes, to be an aspartate residue.";"There has been one structure solved, using X-ray crystallography, for a member of family GH97 (which inverts stereochemistry). This is an enzyme from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, SusB, which is involved in the degradation of starch in the human gut. The tertiary structure of the GH97 enzyme revealed three domains; an N-terminal ?-super-sandwich domain, followed by a canonical (?/?)8 barrel (which houses the catalytic domain) and a C-terminal ?-sheet domain. There have also been complexes solved with the inhibitors acarbose, deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine.

GH98;endo-?-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.-);The glycoside hydrolases of this family are endo-?-galactosidases. No other activities have been reported. Family 98 glycoside hydrolases are unique in their specificity towards cleavage of the type II core in the AB blood group antigens (EABase, Sp3GH98) and LewisY antigens (SpGH98). These enzymes are capable of processing these glycans when presented on cell surfaces thus destroying the antigens.;Family GH98 galactosidases are inverting enzymes, as first shown by NMR monitoring of the Sp4GH98-catalyzed hydrolysis of the LewisY tetrasaccharide. EABase was also shown to act through an inverting enzyme by NMR monitoring of the EABase catalysed hydrolysis of an artificial substrate, DNP-A-trisaccharide. These results are contrary to the initial predictions made by Rigden. EABase follows normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics.;The general base, an aspartate and glutamate diad, and the general acid, glutamate, were identified through the crystal structures of Sp3GH98 and Sp4GH98 in complex with the A trisaccharide and H disaccharide, respectively, and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Similar results were obtained through kinetic studies of the corresponding acid and base mutants of EABase with the artificial substrate dinitrophenyl A-trisaccharide. Further biochemical evidence for the catalytic acid residue was obtained by comparison between the activity of the acid mutant and the pKa of the leaving group of the substrate.;The first crystal structures from family 98 were the Sp3GH98 and Sp4GH98 enzymes from S. pneumoniae in complex with the A trisaccharide and H disaccharide respectively. Both structures feature a (?/ß)8 barrel in the catalytic domain with an adjoining ß-sandwich domain that contributes to the architecture of the active site and helps define the respective specificities of the enzymes;"Created after Anderson et al.

GH99;glycoprotein endo-?-1,2-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.130);Glycoside hydrolases of family GH99 are endo-acting ?-mannosidases that cleave glucose-substituted mannose within immature N-linked glycans of the general formula Glc1-3Man9GlcNAc2 (or structures trimmed in the B and C branches), and possess maximal activity on the monoglucosylated forms. This family was originally created from the mammalian enzyme, cloned by Spiro and co-workers. Mammalian GH99 enzymes are localized to the Golgi apparatus and appear to play a role in the rescue of glucosylated N-linked glycans that have evaded the action of the endoplasmic reticulum exo-glucosidases I and II. Mammalian endo-?-mannosidase has greater activity on glucosylated N-linked glycans that have been trimmed in the non-glucose-substituted branches. There is evidence that mammalian endo-?-mannosidases act on dolichol-bound N-glycan precursors, as well as free oligosaccharides released from N-glycoproteins and which undergo retrograde transport through the secretory pathway. Substrate studies on a bacterial GH99 enzyme from Shewanella amazonensis, and the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides xylanisolvens enzymes have shown that these enzymes can also process Glc1/3Man9/7GlcNAc2 structures, matching the substrate specificity of the mammalian enzymes. Kinetic analysis of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH99 on a fluorescently-labelled Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure yielded kinetic parameters that were similar to that found for the mammalian enzyme. Both mammalian and bacterial enzymes can utilize simple 'reducing end' substrate mimics such as methylumbelliferyl ?-glucosyl-1,3-?-mannopyranoside or ?-glucosyl-1,3-?-mannopyranosyl fluoride, but are inactive on aryl mannosides.;"Family GH99 endo-?-mannosidases are retaining enzymes, as first shown by 1H NMR analysis of the hydrolysis of ?-glucosyl-1,3-?-mannopyranosyl fluoride by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Retaining mannoside hydrolases (eg GH38) typically follow a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. However, X-ray crystallographic analysis of BxGH99 and BtGH99 failed to reveal a candidate nucleophilic residue; instead an alternative mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis by the 2OH residue and proceeding through a 1,2-anhydro sugar was proposed. In this proposal, Glu333 in BxGH99 (Glu329 in BtGH99) acts as a general acid/base to deprotonate the 2OH and protonate the 1,2-anhydrosugar.";"The general acid/base was highlighted by X-ray crystallographic analysis as Glu336 in BxGH99 and Glu332 in BtGH99. The Glu332Ala mutant of BtGH99 shows a 50-fold decrease in catalytic activity relative to the wild-type enzyme using the activated substrate ?-glucosyl-1,3-?-mannopyranosyl fluoride, and undetectable activity against the natural substrate, Glc3Man7GlcNAc2, supporting the role of this residue as general acid/base. As described in ""Kinetics and Mechanism"" the identity of the nucleophilic residue used for catalysis is more obscure and the 2OH of the substrate has been proposed to act as a nucleophile in a mechanism involving substrate assisted catalysis. According to this proposal, Glu333 in BxGH99 (Glu329 in BtGH99) acts as a general acid/base to deprotonate the 2OH and protonate the 1,2-anhydrosugar.";"hree-dimensional structures are available for bacterial members of GH99, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bacteroides xylanisolvens. They have a classical (?/?)8 TIM barrel fold, which is distinguished by the presence of extended loop motifs that form the active site. In different structures of the bacterial enzymes, these loops adopt different conformations, and appear to play a role in recognizing the extended structure of the N-glycan substrate. Binary complexes with two inhibitors, ?-glucosyl-1,3-deoxymannonojirimycin and ?-glucosyl-1,3-isofagomine, and 'active-site-spanning' ternary complexes with the same two inhibitors and the reducing end product fragment 1,2-?-mannobiose, provided insight into active site residues, especially the acid/base (Glu336 in BxGH99; Glu332 in BtGH99) and another key residue that interacts with both the 2OH of the -1 mannose residue and the 6OH of the -2 glucose residue, which provides a rationale for the requirement of a glucosylated-mannoside as the minimal substrate for GH99 enzymes. As discussed in more detail in the ""Kinetics and Mechanism"" section, the precise identity of the nucleophilic residue is unclear, as in all GH99-inhibitor complexes with an occupied -1 subsite there is no candidate nucleophile within a reasonable distance to the ""anomeric"" carbon: in BxGH99 Glu333 is approximately 3.5 ? distant and the OH of Tyr46 and Tyr252 are 4.0 ? distant.";Created after Spiro, Bhoyroo and Spiro (1997) J.

GH102;peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylase (EC 3.2.1.-);The glycoside hydrolases of this family are lytic transglycosylases (also referred to as peptidoglycan lyases) of bacterial origin and they constitute family 2 of the classification scheme of Blackburn and Clarke. The prototype for this family is membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase A (MltA) from Escherichia coli. These enzymes cleave the ?-1,4-linkage between N-acetylmuramoyl and N-acetylglucosaminyl residues in peptidoglycan (Figure 1), but unlike the lytic transglycosylases of other families, they are active on peptidoglycan fragments lacking their stem peptides. No other activities have been observed.;The lytic transglycosidases, strictly speaking, are retaining enzymes. They are not hydrolases but rather catalyse an intramolecular glycosyl transferase reaction onto the C-6 hydroxyl group of the muramoyl residue leading to the generation of a terminal 1,6-anhydromuramoyl product (Figure 1) thus lacking a reducing end. No detailed analyses involving both steady state and pre-steady state kinetic studies have been reported, but the Michaelis Menten (KM and Vmax) parameters have been estimated for E. coli MltA acting on insoluble peptidoglycan sacculi.;As with other lytic transglycosylases (families GH23, GH103, and GH104), the GH102 enzymes are thought to possess a single catalytic general acid/base residue. This residue in E. coli MltA has been identified as Asp308 and, indeed, its replacement with Ala abolishes catalytic activity. The mechanism of action of the family GH102 enzymes has yet to be proven experimentally, but examination of crystal structures of E. coli MltA complexed with chitohexoase has led to the proposal of a novel mechanism of action involving the stabilization of the putative intermediate oxocarbenium ion by an alpha-helix dipole. Thus, the catalytic Asp308 is proposed to serve initially as an acid catalyst to donate a proton to the glycosidic oxygen of the linkage to be cleaved leading to the formation of anintermediate with oxocarbenium ion character (Figure 2). In the absence of an anion/nucleophile in close proximity, this oxocarbenium intermediate is proposed to be stabilized by the negatively-charged side of the dipole that would exist at the C-terminal end of an alpha helix positioned just below the -1 binding subsite. This would be followed by abstraction of the C-6 hydroxyl proton of the intermediate involving Asp308 which now serves as the base catalyst leading to nucleophilic attack and the formation of 1,6-anhydromuramic acid product.;Three-dimensional structures are available for several Family GH103 enzymes, the first solved being that of E. coli MltA. Unlike the other lytic transglycosylases of families GH23, GH103, and GH104 which possesses the well characterized ?+? “lysozyme fold,” these enzymes have a unique structure consisting of two domains. One has a double-? ?-barrel fold similar to the catalytic domain of the family GH45 endoglucanase V from Humicola insolens. The second and smaller domain has a ?-barrel fold topology. The large groove between the two domains serves as the active site cleft.;Corresponds to family 2 of the peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylases described by N.T. Blackburn and A.J. Clarke (2001) J.

GH103;peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylase (EC 3.2.1.-);The glycoside hydrolases of this family are in fact lytic transglycosylases (also referred to as peptidoglycan lyases) of bacterial origin and they constitute family 3 of the classification scheme of Blackburn and Clarke. The prototype for this family is membrane-bound lytic transglycosylase B (MltB) from Escherichia coli. These enzymes cleave the ?-1,4 linkage between N-acetylmuramoyl and N-acetylglucosaminyl residues in peptidoglycan (Figure 1). No other activities have been observed.;The lytic transglycosidases, strictly speaking, are retaining enzymes. However, they are not hydrolases but rather catalyse an intramolecular glycosyl transfer reaction onto the C-6 hydroxyl group of the muramoyl residue leading to the generation of a terminal 1,6-anhydromuramoyl product (Figure 1) that lacks a reducing end. No detailed analyses involving both steady state and pre-steady state kinetic studies have been reported, but the Michaelis-Menten (KM and Vmax) parameters have been estimated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa MltB acting on insoluble peptidoglycan sacculi.;As with other lytic transglycosylases (families GH23, GH102, and GH104), the GH103 enzymes are thought to possess a single catalytic general acid/base residue. This residue has been identified as Glu162 in MltB from both E. coli and P. aeruginosa and, indeed, its replacement abolishes catalytic activity. The mechanism of action of family GH103 enzymes has been investigated the most compared to the lytic transglycosylases of the other families (GH23,GH102, and GH104). Examination of crystal structures of E. coli Slt35 (a soluble proteolytic derivative of MltB) and theoretical considerations led to the proposal of a mechanism that accommodates a single catalytic residue at its active site. Thus, based on the complexes formed with murodipeptide, chitobiose, and the inhibitor bulgecin, a two-step neighboring group participation mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis has been invoked analogous to the family GH18 chitinases and chitobiases, family GH20 N-acetyl-?-hexosaminidases, and family GH23 lytic transglycosylases. Thus, the catalytic residue Glu162 is proposed to serve initially as a general acid to donate a proton to the glycosidic oxygen of the linkage to be cleaved. At the same time the MurNAc 2-acetamido group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the anomeric centre. The transition state leading to the intermediate possesses oxocarbenium ion character (Figure 2). In the second step abstraction of the C-6 hydroxyl proton of the oxazolinium species by Glu162 which now serves as a general base leads to nucleophilic attack and the formation of 1,6-anhydromuramic acid product, again through a transition state with oxocarbenium ion character. The ?-hexosaminidase inhibitor NAG-thiazoline (Figure 2) was found to inhibit P. aeruginosa MltB thus supporting the proposal for the formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate, and the results of a site-directed mutagenesis study suggest that Ser216 orients the N-acetyl group on MurNAc at the -1 subsite of MltB for its participation in a substrate-assisted mechanism of action.;"Three-dimensional structures are available for several family GH103 enzymes, the first solved being that of E. coli MltB (Slt35).

GH104;peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylase (EC 3.2.1.-);The glycoside hydrolases of this family are lytic transglyosylases (also referred to as peptidoglycan lyases) of bacteriophage origin and they constitute family 4 of the classification scheme of Blackburn and Clarke. Unfortunately, the origin of many of the hypothetical enzymes listed in GH104 is misleading because they are encoded within prophages which have been integrated into the chromosome of their bacterial host. In other cases, the phage enzyme has been acquired by pathogenicity islands on the bacterial chromosome. The prototype for this family is the enzyme from lambda phage. These enzymes cleave the ?-1,4 linkage between N-acetylmuramoyl and N-acetylglucosaminyl residues in peptidoglycan (Figure 1). No other activities have been observed.;The lytic transglycosidases, strictly speaking, are retaining enzymes. However, they are not hydrolases but rather catalyse an intramolecular glycosyl transferase reaction onto the C-6 hydroxyl group of the muramoyl residue leading to the generation of a terminal 1,6-anhydromuramoyl product thus lacking a reducing end. No detailed analyses involving either steady state or pre-steady state kinetic studies have been reported.;As with other lytic transglycosylases (families GH23, GH102, and GH103), the GH104 enzymes are thought to possess a single catalytic general acid/base residue. This residue in lambda bacteriophage lytic transglycosylase has been inferred as Glu19 by X-ray crystallography of the enzyme alone and in complex with two chitohexaose oligomers. The role of an essential carboxyl group in the enzyme was confirmed by chemical modification, thus supporting the identification of Glu19. The mechanism of action of the family GH104 enzymes has not been investigated and hence it is not known if they follow that of the lytic transglycosylases of families GH23, GH102, or GH103.;The three-dimensional structure of only the lambda phage enzyme has been solved, and like the other lytic transglycosylases of families GH23, and GH103, it possesses the well characterized ?+? “lysozyme fold.”;Corresponds to family 4 of the peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylases described by N.T.

GH109;?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49);The only activity so far identified in this recently discovered family of glycoside hydrolases is that of ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, although the lack of activity of several family members on GalNAc substrates suggests that other substrates might exist. The most characterized member of this family is the enzyme from Elizabethkingia meningosepticum. Because it operates at neutral pH optimum, this enzyme was used succesfully for the removal of the A antigen on red blood cells thus opening the possibility of blood group conversion to universal group O. The enzyme clearly prefers GalNAc over Gal as the aglycon as indicated by a 2,000-fold reduction in kcat for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl ?-galactoside compared with p-nitrophenyl ?-N-acetyl-galactosaminide and by a more than tenfold increase in Km.;Family GH109 enzymes operate via the unusual NAD-dependent hydrolysis mechanism involving an NAD+ cofactor, that so far has been seen only in Glycoside Hydrolase Family 4 (GH4), despite different overall folds between these families (see below). NMR monitoring of the reaction catalyzed by ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase indicated that the enzyme proceeds with retention of the anomeric configuration and concomitant exchange of the GalNAc H-2 atom for a solvent proton. This, and the indispensable presence of NAD+, indicate that GH109 enzymes most likely operate by a similar retaining mechanism. In this mechanism, the NAD+ molecule oxidizes the substrate at C-3, thereby acidifying the proton at C-2 and producing NADH. Deprotonation of C-2 by an enzymatic base with concomitant elimination of the glycosidic oxygen generates a 1,2-unsaturated intermediate. The reaction is completed by addition of water to the Michael-like acceptor and reduction of the resulting ketone by the NADH molecule, which returns to the initial NAD+ state, ready for another catalytic cycle. The mechanism of GH109 enzymes allows cleavage of thioglycosides and of glycosides of the opposite anomeric configuration (both at a comparatively slow rate), two features that are extremely rare among 'classical' glycosidases.;A stated above the enzymes of this family do not use a classical acid/base catalysis, but instead use a rare catalytic mechanism involving NAD-dependent hydrolysis with an NAD+ cofactor, highly similar to that seen in family Glycoside Hydrolase Family 4. The catalytic machinery therefore comprises NAD+ and Tyr-179, which abstracts H-2 to form the unsaturated intermediate. Subtle differences with family GH4 exist, however, such as the absence in GH109 of an identifiable acid to assist glycosidic bond cleavage. It is believed that this enables the hydrolysis of the 'wrong' anomer.;The three-dimensional structure of Elizabethkingia meningosepticum ?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase has been reported in 2007. The closest structural relatives belong to the Gfo/Idh/MocA oxidoreductase family (Z-score of 29.4 and r.m.s. deviation of 3.0 A for 329 equivalent Ca-atoms for Zymomonas mobilis glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (PDB 1ofg). More distant structural homologs are identified by means of the classical Rossmann fold. The structural similarity includes the active-site architecture, where the spatial arrangement of NAD+ and several other residues is conserved, suggesting a common ancestor that has evolved its NAD+-based molecular mechanism to adapt to diverse metabolic requirements.;"Created following Liu et al.

GH110;"?-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22); ?-1,3-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.-)";This family of glycoside hydrolases was recently discovered following an effort to isolate enzymes for the selective and efficient removal of the terminal ?-galactose residue on B antigen for the enzyme conversion of blood group B to universal group O. The activity of several enzymes has been studied and they display narrow substrate specificity for the branched blood group B oligosaccharide (Gal?1–3(Fuc?1–2)Gal). Interestingly and in contrast to many cases where glycosidases display a higher apparent activity on pNP-substrates than on oligosaccharides, the enzyme from B. fragilis NCTC 9343 (BfGal110A) exhibited a lower activity with pNP-?-Gal (0.3 U/mg) compared to the blood group B substrate (6.6 U/mg). The substrate specificity was remarkably stringent for ?-1,3-linked galactose in the branched blood group B structure. The enzyme cleaved neither ?4Gal linkages found in P1 and Pk blood group antigens nor the ?3Gal linkage in the linear B structure without fucose (the so-called Galili antigen)[1]. In a subsequent study Liu et al. have shown the existence of two distinct subfamilies, one subfamily being exclusively active on the branched blood group B structures, whereas the other subfamily contained linkage specific ?1,3-galactosidases that act equally well on both branched blood group B and linear ?-1,3-Gal structures.;The enzymes of this family are classified as inverting enzymes. The stereochemistry of hydrolysis has been monitored by 1H NMR using p-nitrophenyl ?-galactoside as the substrate and B. fragilisBfGal110B as the enzyme. The results showed that the enzyme initially produces ?-galactose, i.e. operates with overall inversion of the anomeric configuration, which is in striking contrast to all other known ?-galactosidases that use a retaining mechanism (see Glycoside Hydrolase Family 4, Glycoside Hydrolase Family 27, Glycoside Hydrolase Family 36 and Glycoside Hydrolase Family 57) ;Unknown;Unknown;"Created following Liu et al.

Considering the topology of the active site structure, the reaction mechanism for inverting phosphorylase is proposed to be similar to that for inverting glycoside hydrolases. With the aid of general acid residue, the enzymatic phosphorolysis occurs through direct nucleophilic attack by phosphate on the anomeric C-1 carbon, instead of the water molecule activated by a general base residue in the inverting glycoside hydrolase reaction.;The general acid residue was firstly estimated by mutational analysis on ?-1,3-D-galactosyl-D-hexososamine phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium longum.;The first solved 3-D structure was ?-1,3-D-galactosyl-D-hexososamine phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium longum (PDB 2ZUV in complex with GlcNAc, ethylene glycol, and nitrate).

GH115;"xylan ?-1,2-glucuronidase (3.2.1.131); ?-(4-O-methyl)-glucuronidase (3.2.1.-)";Glycoside hydrolases of GH115 display ?-glucuronidase activity. In particular, members of this family catalyze the cleavage of 4-O-methyl D-glucuronic acid sidechains from native xylan polysaccharides (EC 3.2.1.131). In contrast to GH67 enzymes, which only cleave glucuronosyl linkages at the non-reducing ends of xylooligosaccharides, GH115 enzymes remove glucuronic acid from the both terminal and internal regions of xylooligosaccharides and xylans. This substrate specificity was first demonstrated by an ?-glucuronidase purified from Thermoascus aurantiacus, and later for a Schizophyllum commune ?-glucuronidase. Although GH115 was established on the basis of biochemical and sequence analysis of Pichia stipitis (4-O-methyl)-?-glucuronidase, available N-terminal protein sequence of the S. commune enzyme allowed the tentative assignment of this enzyme to GH115, which was later confirmed by the full protein sequence. A GH115 member from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis produces both 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid and non-methylated D-glucuronic acid from xylan and xylo-oligosaccharides.;Using reduced aldopentauronic acid (MeGlcA3Xyl4-ol) as a substrate, analysis by 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the enzymes from both S. commune and P. stipitis release the ?-anomer of 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA) as the first-formed product, thus suggesting a one step, inverting mechanism.;The catalytic residues have not yet been identified in a member of this family;No 3D structure has been solved for this family at present, although crystallization of a Streptomyces pristinaespiralis homolog has been reported.;created from reading Ryabova et al.

GH116;"acid ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.45); ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21); ?-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37)";This family of glycoside hydrolases was recently discovered characterising a new ?-glycosidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus and contains acid ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.45), ?-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) and ?-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) activities from the three domains of life. The ?-glycosidase from S. solfataricus (SSO1353) is specific for the gluco- and xylosides ?-bound to hydrophobic groups that are hydrolyzed by following a retaining reaction mechanism. SSO1353 is distantly related to the human non-lysosomal bile acid ?-glucosidase GBA2, also known as glucocerebrosidase, involved in the catabolism of glucosylceramide, which is then converted to sphingomyelin. SSO1353 has substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity slightly different from those of GBA2. In fact, the archaeal enzyme can hydrolyze both aryl ?-gluco and ?-xylosides and it is inhibited by both N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) and conduritol ?-epoxide (CBE). Instead, GBA2 is inactive on methylumbellyferyl-?-D-xylopyranoside and is relatively insensitive to CBE.;The enzymes of this family are retaining glycoside hydrolases and follow the classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism. The stereochemistry of hydrolysis has been demonstrated by 1H-13C NMR spectroscopy analysis of the interglycosidic linkage of disaccharides formed by the transglycosylation reaction of SSO1353 with 4NP-?-Xyl.;The catalytic residues were identified in the S. solfataricus ?-glycosidase. The catalytic nucleophile was identified as Glu335 through trapping of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl-enzyme intermediate and MS/MS analysis. The general acid/base catalyst role was assigned to Asp462 through mechanistic analysis of a mutant at that position, which included azide rescue experiments.;There is currently no 3-D structure representative for GH116 (see GH116 at CAZy DB).;;;;;retaining;;;;;;Asp;Glu;
GH117;"?-1,3-L-neoagarooligosaccharide hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.-); ?-1,3-L-neoagarobiase / neoagarobiose hydrolase (EC 3.2.1.-)";The only activity so far characterized within this recently discovered family of glycoside hydrolases is that of ?-1,3-L-(3,6-anhydro)-galactosidase. Nevertheless phylogenetic analyses (Figure 1) of this family together with activity tests for another member, Zg3597 (Clade C), show that the family GH117 most probably is polyspecific.;The stereochemical outcome of members of glycoside hydrolase family GH117 is still unknown. The first 3D structure revealed the presence of a zinc ion, directly coordinated only by water molecules, close to the active site, which could activate the catalytic water molecule and provide the energy needed for the enzymatic reaction. Sequence alignments suggest that the enzymes of clades B and C do not bind zinc ions, which could be related to their difference in substrate specificity.;From structural analysis and sequence alignments the catalytic residues have been predicted to be two of the three acidic residues Asp-97, Asp-252 and Glu-310 (Zg4663 numbering).;At the moment two members of GH117 family have been crystallized. Both are enzymes from marine bacteria, one from Saccharophagus degradans and one from Zobelia galactanivorans. A crystal structure has only been reported for the ?-1,3-L-(3,6-anhydro)-galactosidase (AhgA, Zg4663) from Z. galactanivorans (PDB: 3p2n). AhgA adopts a five-bladed ?-propeller fold and forms a dimer via domain-swapping of the N-terminal HTH (Helix-Turn-Helix) domain (Figure 2). Interestingly, previous sequences reported from Vibrio sp. JT0107 and Bacillus sp. MK03 contain the conserved domain-swapping signature SxAxxR in the HTH domain. Consistently, these proteins were reported to form multimers (a dimer and an octamer respectively), based on calibrated gel filtration estimations. In contrast, RB13146 (Clade B) lacks the domain-swapping signature, in which the crucial residues are missing. This enzyme from R. baltica thus likely occurs as a monomer and may represent an ‘ancestral’ form of the GH117 family, which would be limited to the catalytic ?-propeller domain.;Distantly related to family GH43;;;;unknown;;;;;;unknown;unknown;

GH129;"?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49);";"This family of glycoside hydrolases was recently established for NagBb from Bifidobacterium bifidum JCM 1254, which shows slight sequence similarity with GH101 endo-?-N-acetylgalactosaminidases. NagBb more rapidly act on GalNAc?1-pNP than Gal?1-3GalNAc?1-pNP; therefore its substrate specificity is quite different from GH101 enzymes (EC 3.2.1.97). It is also different from those of previously known exo-?-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.49) in GH27, GH36 and GH109. Thus, NagBb should be called as exo/endo-?-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. NagBb most preferably hydrolyzes GalNAc?1-Ser, a minimal structure of Tn antigen on mucin-type glycoproteins, suggesting that NagBb might be involved in degradation of intestinal mucins. The members of GH129 are distributed in several bifidobacterial species such as B. longum subsp. longum, B. longum subsp. infants and B. breve, which are frequently found in intestines of infants.";"NagBb is a retaining enzyme.

CBM13;Modules of approx. 150 residues which always appear as a threefold internal repeat. The only apparent exception to this, xylanase II of Actinomadura sp. FC7 (GenBank U08894), is in fact not completely sequenced. These modules were first identified in several plant lectins such as ricin or agglutinin of Ricinus communis which bind galactose residues. The three-dimensional structure of a plant lectin has been determined and displays a pseudo-threefold symmetry in accord with the observed sequence threefold repeat. These modules have since been found in a number of other proteins of various functions including glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. While in the plant lectins this module binds mannose, binding to xylan has been demonstrated in the Streptomyces lividans xylanase A and arabinofuranosidase B. Binding to GalNAc has been shown for the corresponding module of GalNAc transferase 4. For the other proteins, the binding specificity of these modules has not been established.
